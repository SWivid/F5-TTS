4992-41806-0009	4.355	exclaimed Bill Harmon to his wife as they went through the lighted hall.	4992-23283-0000	6.645	But the more forgetfulness had then prevailed, the more powerful was the force of remembrance when she awoke.
4992-23283-0001	2.71	Miss Milner's health is not good"!	4992-23283-0003	4.645	So there is to me"! added Sandford, with a sarcastic sneer.
4992-23283-0015	3.675	Is she not afraid that I will thwart her inclinations"?	4992-23283-0004	8.06	And yet you must own her behaviour has warranted them has it not been in this particular incoherent and unaccountable"?
4992-23283-0015	3.675	Is she not afraid that I will thwart her inclinations"?	4992-23283-0007	4.045	To ask any more questions of you, I believe, would be unfair.
4992-41797-0012	2.705	She is wild to know how to do things.	4992-23283-0008	4.91	He seemed to wait for her reply; but as she made none, he proceeded-
4992-41797-0016	3.3	They couldn't run nor move; they're just pasteboard".	4992-23283-0009	8.395	Oh! my Lord," cried Miss Woodley, with a most forcible accent, " You are the last person on earth she would pardon me for entrusting".
4992-41797-0005	3.845	Done? He ain't done a thing he'd oughter sence he was born.	4992-23283-0010	5	But in such a case, Miss Milner's election of a husband shall not direct mine.
4992-41797-0012	2.705	She is wild to know how to do things.	4992-23283-0011	4.225	If she does not know how to estimate her own value, I do.
4992-41806-0004	3.7	Burn, fire, burn! Flicker, flicker, flame!	4992-23283-0013	6.63	My Lord, Miss Milner's taste is not a depraved one; it is but too refined".
4992-41797-0012	2.705	She is wild to know how to do things.	4992-23283-0014	4.535	What can you mean by that, Miss Woodley? You talk mysteriously.
4992-41797-0012	2.705	She is wild to know how to do things.	4992-23283-0016	4.495	Again he searched his own thoughts; nor ineffectually as before.
4992-23283-0007	4.045	To ask any more questions of you, I believe, would be unfair.	4992-23283-0018	6.575	To relieve her from both, he laid his hand with force upon his heart, and said, "Do you believe me"?
4992-23283-0016	4.495	Again he searched his own thoughts; nor ineffectually as before.	4992-23283-0019	6.585	I will make no unjust use of what I know," he replied with firmness. "I believe you, my Lord".
672-122797-0005	3.26	Oh, that made him so angry!	672-122797-0000	4.07	Out in the woods stood a nice little Fir Tree.
672-122797-0029	3.05	How it will shine this evening"!	672-122797-0003	4.76	But this was what the Tree could not bear to hear.
672-122797-0000	4.07	Out in the woods stood a nice little Fir Tree.	672-122797-0007	6.42	In autumn the wood cutters always came and felled some of the largest trees.
672-122797-0000	4.07	Out in the woods stood a nice little Fir Tree.	672-122797-0012	7.765	I would fain know if I am destined for so glorious a career," cried the Tree, rejoicing.
672-122797-0029	3.05	How it will shine this evening"!	672-122797-0013	8.705	I am now tall, and my branches spread like the others that were carried off last year! Oh!
672-122797-0032	4	cried the young ladies, and they quickly put out the fire.	672-122797-0015	4.455	Were I in the warm room with all the splendor and magnificence!
672-122797-0044	3.74	And he leaned against the wall lost in reverie.	672-122797-0016	9.215	Yes; then something better, something still grander, will surely follow, or wherefore should they thus ornament me?
672-122797-0041	3.88	In the morning the servant and the housemaid came in.	672-122797-0017	4.82	Something better, something still grander must follow - but what?
672-122797-0000	4.07	Out in the woods stood a nice little Fir Tree.	672-122797-0018	4.93	Rejoice in our presence"! said the Air and the Sunlight.
672-122797-0047	3.325	How kind man is, after all!	672-122797-0019	4.11	Rejoice in thy own fresh youth"!
672-122797-0053	2.955	They were so extremely curious.	672-122797-0020	8.825	But the Tree did not rejoice at all; he grew and grew, and was green both winter and summer.
672-122797-0032	4	cried the young ladies, and they quickly put out the fire.	672-122797-0021	4.15	and towards Christmas he was one of the first that was cut down.
672-122797-0032	4	cried the young ladies, and they quickly put out the fire.	672-122797-0023	9.695063	He well knew that he should never see his dear old comrades, the little bushes and flowers around him, anymore; perhaps not even the birds!
672-122797-0059	3.52	Only that one," answered the Tree.	672-122797-0024	4.13	The departure was not at all agreeable.
672-122797-0000	4.07	Out in the woods stood a nice little Fir Tree.	672-122797-0027	4.79	The servants, as well as the young ladies, decorated it.
672-122797-0015	4.455	Were I in the warm room with all the splendor and magnificence!	672-122797-0030	4.575	Perhaps the other trees from the forest will come to look at me!
672-122797-0015	4.455	Were I in the warm room with all the splendor and magnificence!	672-122797-0032	4	cried the young ladies, and they quickly put out the fire.
672-122797-0015	4.455	Were I in the warm room with all the splendor and magnificence!	672-122797-0034	5.11	A story"! cried the children, drawing a little fat man towards the Tree.
672-122797-0011	2.54	And then? What happens then"?	672-122797-0036	5.365	Humpy Dumpy fell downstairs, and yet he married the princess!
672-122797-0044	3.74	And he leaned against the wall lost in reverie.	672-122797-0038	8.8	thought the Fir Tree, and believed it all, because the man who told the story was so good looking. "Well, well!
672-122797-0043	3.78	What's the meaning of this"? thought the Tree.	672-122797-0039	4.025	I won't tremble tomorrow"! thought the Fir Tree.
672-122797-0000	4.07	Out in the woods stood a nice little Fir Tree.	672-122797-0040	5.125	And the whole night the Tree stood still and in deep thought.
672-122797-0059	3.52	Only that one," answered the Tree.	672-122797-0046	4.715	Tis now winter out of doors"! thought the Tree.
672-122797-0054	4.25	I know no such place," said the Tree.	672-122797-0048	6.555	If it only were not so dark here, and so terribly lonely!
672-122797-0041	3.88	In the morning the servant and the housemaid came in.	672-122797-0050	4.855	They snuffed about the Fir Tree, and rustled among the branches.
672-122797-0054	4.25	I know no such place," said the Tree.	672-122797-0051	4.665	I am by no means old," said the Fir Tree.
672-122797-0011	2.54	And then? What happens then"?	672-122797-0052	4.285	There's many a one considerably older than I am".
672-122797-0031	3.98	It blazed up famously. "Help! Help"!	672-122797-0054	4.25	I know no such place," said the Tree.
672-122797-0032	4	cried the young ladies, and they quickly put out the fire.	672-122797-0055	8.23	And then he told all about his youth; and the little Mice had never heard the like before; and they listened and said,
672-122797-0000	4.07	Out in the woods stood a nice little Fir Tree.	672-122797-0056	5.225	said the Fir Tree, thinking over what he had himself related.
672-122797-0065	3.03	Now that too is over.	672-122797-0057	6.56	Yes, in reality those were happy times".
672-122797-0000	4.07	Out in the woods stood a nice little Fir Tree.	672-122797-0058	4.47	Who is Humpy Dumpy"? asked the Mice.
672-122797-0005	3.26	Oh, that made him so angry!	672-122797-0061	7.59	Don't you know one about bacon and tallow candles? Can't you tell any larder stories"?
672-122797-0021	4.15	and towards Christmas he was one of the first that was cut down.	672-122797-0066	4.815	Why, one morning there came a quantity of people and set to work in the loft.
672-122797-0010	3.815	Rejoice in thy growth"! said the Sunbeams.	672-122797-0068	4.02	but it was not the Fir Tree that they meant.
672-122797-0028	2.61	This evening"! they all said.	672-122797-0069	5.01	It was in a corner that he lay, among weeds and nettles.
672-122797-0032	4	cried the young ladies, and they quickly put out the fire.	672-122797-0070	6.27	The golden star of tinsel was still on the top of the Tree, and glittered in the sunshine.
672-122797-0021	4.15	and towards Christmas he was one of the first that was cut down.	672-122797-0071	8.875	In the court yard some of the merry children were playing who had danced at Christmas round the Fir Tree, and were so glad at the sight of him.
672-122797-0000	4.07	Out in the woods stood a nice little Fir Tree.	672-122797-0072	7.94	And the gardener's boy chopped the Tree into small pieces; there was a whole heap lying there.
672-122797-0053	2.955	They were so extremely curious.	672-122797-0073	8.205	The wood flamed up splendidly under the large brewing copper, and it sighed so deeply!
672-122797-0062	2.675	No," said the Tree.	672-122797-0074	8.73	However, that was over now - the Tree gone, the story at an end.
2961-961-0005	3.775	Some poems of Solon were recited by the boys.	2961-960-0001	8.250063	The influence with the Timaeus has exercised upon posterity is due partly to a misunderstanding.
2961-961-0005	3.775	Some poems of Solon were recited by the boys.	2961-960-0004	8.22	There is no danger of the modern commentators on the Timaeus falling into the absurdities of the Neo Platonists.
2961-961-0005	3.775	Some poems of Solon were recited by the boys.	2961-960-0007	7.64	But they have nothing to do with the interpretation of Plato, and in spirit they are opposed to him.
2961-961-0005	3.775	Some poems of Solon were recited by the boys.	2961-960-0012	6.89	Many, if not all the elements of the Pre Socratic philosophy are included in the Timaeus.
2961-961-0005	3.775	Some poems of Solon were recited by the boys.	2961-960-0014	8.775	The ideas also remain, but they have become types in nature, forms of men, animals, birds, fishes.
2961-961-0005	3.775	Some poems of Solon were recited by the boys.	2961-960-0015	7.83	The style and plan of the Timaeus differ greatly from that of any other of the Platonic dialogues.
2961-961-0005	3.775	Some poems of Solon were recited by the boys.	2961-960-0016	7.76	But Plato has not the same mastery over his instrument which he exhibits in the Phaedrus or Symposium.
2961-961-0005	3.775	Some poems of Solon were recited by the boys.	2961-960-0017	7.87	Nothing can exceed the beauty or art of the introduction, in which he is using words after his accustomed manner.
2961-961-0005	3.775	Some poems of Solon were recited by the boys.	2961-960-0018	8.38	But in the rest of the work the power of language seems to fail him, and the dramatic form is wholly given up.
2961-961-0005	3.775	Some poems of Solon were recited by the boys.	2961-960-0020	9.88	And hence we find the same sort of clumsiness in the Timaeus of Plato which characterizes the philosophical poem of Lucretius.
2961-961-0005	3.775	Some poems of Solon were recited by the boys.	2961-960-0022	7.425	Plato had not the command of his materials which would have enabled him to produce a perfect work of art.
8224-274384-0003	3.87	or hath he given us any gift?	8224-274381-0011	6.48	His conduct and presence of mind in this emergence appeared conspicuous.
1221-135766-0013	3.645	Pearl was a born outcast of the infantile world.	1221-135767-0005	5.865	It was the scarlet letter in another form: the scarlet letter endowed with life!
1221-135766-0015	2.63	If spoken to, she would not speak again.	1221-135767-0010	8.2	She screamed and shouted, too, with a terrific volume of sound, which, doubtless, caused the hearts of the fugitives to quake within them.
1221-135767-0008	3.095	Come, therefore, and let us fling mud at them"!	1221-135767-0014	7.07	Yea, his honourable worship is within. But he hath a godly minister or two with him, and likewise a leech.
1221-135767-0020	3.345	In truth, she seemed absolutely hidden behind it.	1221-135767-0024	5.85	Pearl, seeing the rose bushes, began to cry for a red rose, and would not be pacified.
7176-88083-0008	3.28	In despair he hurled himself downward too soon.	7176-92135-0001	7.56	In short he becomes a "prominent figure in London Society" - and, if he is not careful, somebody will say so.
7176-92135-0007	3.275	Anyhow it's jolly exciting, and I can do the dialogue all right.	7176-92135-0005	5.47	But suppose you said, "I'm fond of writing; my people always say my letters home are good enough for Punch.
7176-92135-0027	2.835	Lady Larkspur starts suddenly and turns towards him.	7176-92135-0006	7.795	I've got a little idea for a play about a man and a woman and another woman, and - but perhaps I'd better keep the plot a secret for the moment.
7176-88083-0009	4.045	The great hawk followed hurriedly, to retrieve his prey from the ground.	7176-92135-0008	4.43	Lend me your ear for ten minutes, and you shall learn just what stagecraft is".
7176-92135-0004	2.425	Frankly I cannot always say.	7176-92135-0009	4.38	And I should begin with a short homily on Soliloquy.
7176-88083-0016	3.92	Straightway the hawk glided from his perch and darted after him.	7176-92135-0015	6.755	And so on, till you get to the end, when Ophelia might say, "Ah, yes," or something non committal of that sort.
7176-88083-0006	4.295	It might have seemed that a trout of this size was a fairly substantial meal.	7176-92135-0016	7.545	This would be an easy way of doing it, but it would not be the best way, for the reason that it is too easy to call attention to itself.
7176-88083-0016	3.92	Straightway the hawk glided from his perch and darted after him.	7176-92135-0017	7.17	In the old badly made play it was frequently necessary for one of the characters to take the audience into his confidence.
7176-88083-0016	3.92	Straightway the hawk glided from his perch and darted after him.	7176-92135-0018	8.94	In the modern well constructed play he simply rings up an imaginary confederate and tells him what he is going to do. Could anything be more natural?
7176-88083-0008	3.28	In despair he hurled himself downward too soon.	7176-92135-0020	7.165	Double nine two three, Elsinore.... Double- nine, yes.... Hallo, is that you, Horatio? Hamlet speaking.
7176-88083-0016	3.92	Straightway the hawk glided from his perch and darted after him.	7176-92135-0022	8.23	To be or not to be, that is the question; whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows - What? No, Hamlet speaking.
7176-92135-0002	3.415	But even the unsuccessful dramatist has his moments.	7176-92135-0023	6.215	You gave me double- five, I want double- nine.... Hallo, is that you, Horatio? Hamlet speaking.
7176-92135-0026	2.95	Enter Hamlet with his favourite boar hound.	7176-92135-0024	4.1	To be or not to be, that is the question; whether 'tis nobler
7176-88083-0016	3.92	Straightway the hawk glided from his perch and darted after him.	7176-92135-0042	7.27	In novels the hero has often "pushed his meals away untasted," but no stage hero would do anything so unnatural as this.
7176-92135-0007	3.275	Anyhow it's jolly exciting, and I can do the dialogue all right.	7176-92135-0044	5.175	But it is the cigarette which chiefly has brought the modern drama to its present state of perfection.
4077-13754-0001	3.77	But a word further concerning the expedition in general.	4077-13751-0001	8.745	Its origin was small - a germ, an insignificant seed, hardly to be thought of as likely to arouse opposition.
4077-13754-0001	3.77	But a word further concerning the expedition in general.	4077-13751-0002	9.75	Instead of but six regularly affiliated members, and at most two score of adherents, the organization numbers today many hundred thousand souls.
4077-13751-0013	4.315	Their sufferings have never yet been fitly chronicled by human scribe.	4077-13751-0010	6.72	To the fervent Latter day Saint, a temple is not simply a church building, a house for religious assembly.
4077-13751-0019	2.92	Who began the quarrel? Was it the "Mormons"?	4077-13751-0013	4.315	Their sufferings have never yet been fitly chronicled by human scribe.
4077-13754-0001	3.77	But a word further concerning the expedition in general.	4077-13751-0017	5.095	Oh, what a record to read; what a picture to gaze upon; how awful the fact!
6930-81414-0019	3.38	Voltaire picked up something from the ground and looked at it.	6930-76324-0002	5.56	The poor little things"! cried Cynthia. "Think of them having been turned to the wall all these years!
6930-76324-0009	3.405	Do you suppose the miniature was a copy of the same thing"?	6930-76324-0004	6.15	But Joyce had not been listening. All at once she put down her candle on the table and faced her companion.
6930-76324-0009	3.405	Do you suppose the miniature was a copy of the same thing"?	6930-76324-0005	5.035	The twin brother did something she didn't like, and she turned his picture to the wall.
6930-76324-0001	3.2	They were certainly no nearer the solution of their problem.	6930-76324-0006	4.455	Hers happened to be in the same frame too, but she evidently didn't care about that.
6930-76324-0006	4.455	Hers happened to be in the same frame too, but she evidently didn't care about that.	6930-76324-0008	5.185	I thought we were 'stumped' again when I first saw that picture, but it's been of some use, after all.
6930-76324-0026	3.085	Isn't he the greatest for getting into odd corners"!	6930-76324-0011	9.24	They worry me terribly. And, besides, I'd like to see what this lovely furniture looks like without such quantities of dust all over it". "Good scheme, CYN"!
6930-76324-0006	4.455	Hers happened to be in the same frame too, but she evidently didn't care about that.	6930-76324-0012	4.655	We'll come in here this afternoon with old clothes on, and have a regular house cleaning!
6930-76324-0010	2.69	What in the world is that"? queried Joyce.	6930-76324-0013	4.305	It can't hurt anything, I'm sure, for we won't disturb things at all.
6930-76324-0007	2.82	Now what have you to say, Cynthia Sprague"?	6930-76324-0014	4.72	This thought, however, did not enter the heads of the enthusiastic pair.
6930-76324-0019	2.575	Now let's dust the furniture and pictures".	6930-76324-0016	9.205	The lure proved too much for him, and he came sporting after it, as friskily as a young kitten, much to Cynthia's delight when she caught sight of him.
6930-81414-0018	2.93	I remember saying. "Have we been together"?	6930-76324-0017	5.41	Oh, let him come along"! she urged. "I do love to see him about that old house.
6930-76324-0025	4.12	Why, it's Goliath as usual"! they both cried, peering in.	6930-76324-0020	6.315	Yet, little as it was, it had already made a vast difference in the aspect of the room.
6930-76324-0007	2.82	Now what have you to say, Cynthia Sprague"?	6930-76324-0021	7.355	Surface dust at least had been removed, and the fine old furniture gave a hint of its real elegance and polish.
6930-76324-0013	4.305	It can't hurt anything, I'm sure, for we won't disturb things at all.	6930-76324-0023	4.85	And my pocket money is getting low again, and you haven't any left, as usual.
6930-76324-0026	3.085	Isn't he the greatest for getting into odd corners"!	6930-76324-0024	4.05	They say illumination by candle light is the prettiest in the world.
6930-81414-0012	4.43	said another voice, which I recognized as Voltaire's. "Kaffar?	6930-76324-0025	4.12	Why, it's Goliath as usual"! they both cried, peering in.
6930-81414-0019	3.38	Voltaire picked up something from the ground and looked at it.	6930-76324-0027	8.27	Forgetting all their weariness, they seized their candles and scurried through the house, finding an occasional paper tucked away in some odd corner.
6930-81414-0018	2.93	I remember saying. "Have we been together"?	6930-76324-0028	9.875	Well, I'm convinced that the Boarded up House mystery happened not earlier than april sixteenth, eighteen sixty one, and probably not much later.
6930-76324-0007	2.82	Now what have you to say, Cynthia Sprague"?	6930-81414-0004	9.56	The story of its evil influence came back to me, and in my bewildered condition I wondered whether there was not some truth in what had been said.
6930-75918-0000	3.505	Concord returned to its place amidst the tents.	6930-81414-0006	6.8	What then? A human hand, large and shapely, appeared distinctly on the surface of the pond.
6930-75918-0011	3.195	I am convinced of what I say," said the count.	6930-81414-0007	4.365	Nothing more, not even the wrist to which it might be attached.
6930-75918-0013	2.94	In those very terms; I even added more.	6930-81414-0008	6.055	It did not beckon, or indeed move at all; it was as still as the hand of death.
6930-81414-0010	3.835	A sound of voices. A flash of light.	6930-81414-0011	4.7	A feeling of freedom, and I was awake! Where?
6930-76324-0025	4.12	Why, it's Goliath as usual"! they both cried, peering in.	6930-81414-0012	4.43	said another voice, which I recognized as Voltaire's. "Kaffar?
6930-81414-0007	4.365	Nothing more, not even the wrist to which it might be attached.	6930-81414-0013	7.325	I had scarcely known what I had been saying or doing up to this time, but as he spoke I looked at my hand.
6930-75918-0007	3.315	You will be frank with me"? "I always am".	6930-81414-0014	7.41	In the light of the moon I saw a knife red with blood, and my hand, too, was also discoloured.
6930-81414-0025	2.53	My position was too terrible.	6930-81414-0020	5	I say you do know what this means, and you must tell us".
6930-81414-0027	3.85	For some time after that I remembered nothing distinctly.	6930-81414-0022	4.34	I had again been acting under the influence of this man's power.
6930-81414-0021	3.225	A terrible thought flashed into my mind.	6930-81414-0023	4.885	Perchance, too, Kaffar's death might serve him in good stead.
6930-75918-0010	3.035	I can perceive love clearly enough".	6930-81414-0024	5.05	My tongue refused to articulate; my power of speech left me.
1221-135766-0015	2.63	If spoken to, she would not speak again.	1221-135766-0002	4.825	Yet these thoughts affected Hester Prynne less with hope than apprehension.
1221-135766-0015	2.63	If spoken to, she would not speak again.	1221-135766-0004	7.44	This outward mutability indicated, and did not more than fairly express, the various properties of her inner life.
1221-135766-0013	3.645	Pearl was a born outcast of the infantile world.	1221-135766-0007	8.795	Hester Prynne, nevertheless, the loving mother of this one child, ran little risk of erring on the side of undue severity.
1221-135767-0020	3.345	In truth, she seemed absolutely hidden behind it.	1221-135766-0014	4.75	Pearl saw, and gazed intently, but never sought to make acquaintance.
7021-79740-0012	3.26	said she, pointing to the playthings; "see!	7021-79730-0005	8.01	So you will be a good girl, I know, and not make any trouble, but will stay at home contentedly - won't you?
8463-294828-0021	2.735	A route slightly less direct, that's all.	8463-294825-0001	7.805	This reality begins to explain the dark power and otherworldly fascination of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas.
8463-287645-0014	3.02	of starting. I didn't know the way to come.	8463-294825-0003	9.935	Nemo builds a fabulous futuristic submarine, the Nautilus, then conducts an underwater campaign of vengeance against his imperialist oppressor.
8463-287645-0001	3.545	It is hardly necessary to say more of them here.	8463-294825-0005	7.7	Other subtleties occur inside each episode, the textures sparkling with wit, information, and insight.
8463-287645-0001	3.545	It is hardly necessary to say more of them here.	8463-294825-0010	4.580063	And in this last action he falls into the classic sin of Pride.
8463-287645-0009	3.71	I never knew of but one man who could ever please him.	8463-294825-0012	5.965063	The Nautilus nearly perishes in the Antarctic and Nemo sinks into a growing depression.
1580-141083-0021	3.715	There is no opening except the one pane," said our learned guide.	1580-141083-0000	8.94	I will endeavour, in my statement, to avoid such terms as would serve to limit the events to any particular place, or give a clue as to the people concerned.
1580-141084-0034	4.49	Well, well, don't trouble to answer. Listen, and see that I do you no injustice.	1580-141083-0002	6.135	My friend's temper had not improved since he had been deprived of the congenial surroundings of Baker Street.
1580-141083-0023	3.33	One could hardly hope for any upon so dry a day.	1580-141083-0003	6.55	Without his scrapbooks, his chemicals, and his homely untidiness, he was an uncomfortable man.
1580-141084-0003	4.1	No names, please"! said Holmes, as we knocked at Gilchrist's door.	1580-141083-0004	4.515	I had to read it over carefully, as the text must be absolutely correct.
1580-141084-0045	3.625	Suddenly he heard him at the very door. There was no possible escape.	1580-141083-0007	4.565	The moment I looked at my table, I was aware that someone had rummaged among my papers.
1580-141083-0011	2.825	A broken tip of lead was lying there also.	1580-141083-0008	4.305	The proof was in three long slips. I had left them all together.
1580-141083-0030	3.48	mister Soames was somewhat overwhelmed by this flood of information.	1580-141083-0009	7.04	The alternative was that someone passing had observed the key in the door, had known that I was out, and had entered to look at the papers.
1580-141083-0030	3.48	mister Soames was somewhat overwhelmed by this flood of information.	1580-141083-0010	5.32	I gave him a little brandy and left him collapsed in a chair, while I made a most careful examination of the room.
1580-141083-0050	3.085	I really don't think he knew much about it, mister Holmes.	1580-141083-0012	7.065	Not only this, but on the table I found a small ball of black dough or clay, with specks of something which looks like sawdust in it.
1580-141083-0019	2.705	Above were three students, one on each story.	1580-141083-0013	4.32	Above all things, I desire to settle the matter quietly and discreetly".
1580-141083-0048	2.785	How came you to leave the key in the door"?	1580-141083-0015	4.985	Did anyone know that these proofs would be there"? "No one save the printer".
1580-141084-0021	4.01	On the palm were three little pyramids of black, doughy clay.	1580-141083-0016	4.255	I was in such a hurry to come to you". "You left your door open"?
1580-141083-0036	3.98	Holmes held it out on his open palm in the glare of the electric light.	1580-141083-0020	5.135	Then he approached it, and, standing on tiptoe with his neck craned, he looked into the room.
1580-141084-0050	2.78	If mister Soames saw them, the game was up.	1580-141083-0024	4.48	You left him in a chair, you say. Which chair"? "By the window there".
1580-141084-0037	2.965	When I approached your room, I examined the window.	1580-141083-0026	4.775	As a matter of fact, he could not," said Soames, "for I entered by the side door".
1580-141083-0030	3.48	mister Soames was somewhat overwhelmed by this flood of information.	1580-141083-0027	5.225	How long would it take him to do that, using every possible contraction? A quarter of an hour, not less.
1580-141084-0050	2.78	If mister Soames saw them, the game was up.	1580-141083-0031	6.25	Holmes held out a small chip with the letters NN and a space of clear wood after them. "You see"?
1580-141084-0036	2.475	The Indian I also thought nothing of.	1580-141083-0032	4.135	Watson, I have always done you an injustice. There are others.
1580-141084-0045	3.625	Suddenly he heard him at the very door. There was no possible escape.	1580-141083-0033	7.45	I was hoping that if the paper on which he wrote was thin, some trace of it might come through upon this polished surface. No, I see nothing.
1580-141083-0025	3.905	The man entered and took the papers, sheet by sheet, from the central table.	1580-141083-0034	6.99	As Holmes drew the curtain I was aware, from some little rigidity and alertness of his attitude, that he was prepared for an emergency.
1580-141084-0050	2.78	If mister Soames saw them, the game was up.	1580-141083-0035	4.98	Holmes turned away, and stooped suddenly to the floor. "Hello! What's this"?
1580-141083-0030	3.48	mister Soames was somewhat overwhelmed by this flood of information.	1580-141083-0037	5.73	What could he do? He caught up everything which would betray him, and he rushed into your bedroom to conceal himself".
1580-141083-0036	3.98	Holmes held it out on his open palm in the glare of the electric light.	1580-141083-0038	7.535	I understand you to say that there are three students who use this stair, and are in the habit of passing your door"? "Yes, there are".
1580-141083-0024	4.48	You left him in a chair, you say. Which chair"? "By the window there".	1580-141083-0042	5.865	My scholar has been left very poor, but he is hard working and industrious. He will do well.
1580-141084-0014	3.97	Why, Bannister, the servant. What's his game in the matter"?	1580-141083-0044	5.505	I dare not go so far as that. But, of the three, he is perhaps the least unlikely".
1580-141083-0025	3.905	The man entered and took the papers, sheet by sheet, from the central table.	1580-141083-0045	4.36	He was still suffering from this sudden disturbance of the quiet routine of his life.
1580-141083-0052	3.45	Oh, I would not venture to say, sir.	1580-141083-0053	4.015	You haven't seen any of them"? "No, sir".
4992-41797-0003	2.835	mister Popham laid down his brush.	4992-41797-0000	5.485	Yes, dead these four years, an' a good job for her, too.
4992-41797-0003	2.835	mister Popham laid down his brush.	4992-41797-0002	5.625	Grandfather was Alexander Carey, L L. D., - Doctor of Laws, that is".
4992-23283-0016	4.495	Again he searched his own thoughts; nor ineffectually as before.	4992-41797-0004	7.315	I swan to man"! he ejaculated. "If you don't work hard you can't keep up with the times! Doctor of Laws!
4992-23283-0015	3.675	Is she not afraid that I will thwart her inclinations"?	4992-41797-0006	4.55	He keeps the thou shalt not commandments first rate, Hen Lord does!
4992-23283-0015	3.675	Is she not afraid that I will thwart her inclinations"?	4992-41797-0007	6.905	He give up his position and shut the family up in that tomb of a house so 't he could study his books.
4992-41797-0012	2.705	She is wild to know how to do things.	4992-41797-0008	8.965	mister Popham exaggerated nothing, but on the contrary left much unsaid in his narrative of the family at the House of Lords.
4992-41797-0003	2.835	mister Popham laid down his brush.	4992-41797-0010	6.82	Always irritable, cold, indifferent, he had grown rapidly more so as years went on.
4992-41797-0016	3.3	They couldn't run nor move; they're just pasteboard".	4992-41797-0011	5.445	Whatever appealed to her sense of beauty was straightway transferred to paper or canvas.
4992-41806-0009	4.355	exclaimed Bill Harmon to his wife as they went through the lighted hall.	4992-41797-0013	9.8	She makes effort after effort, trembling with eagerness, and when she fails to reproduce what she sees, she works herself into a frenzy of grief and disappointment".
4992-41806-0009	4.355	exclaimed Bill Harmon to his wife as they went through the lighted hall.	4992-41797-0014	7.215	When she could not make a rabbit or a bird look "real" on paper, she searched in her father's books for pictures of its bones.
4992-41806-0009	4.355	exclaimed Bill Harmon to his wife as they went through the lighted hall.	4992-41797-0015	8.65	Cyril, there must be some better way of doing; I just draw the outline of an animal and then I put hairs or feathers on it. They have no bodies.
4992-23283-0011	4.225	If she does not know how to estimate her own value, I do.	4992-41797-0017	8.69	He wouldn't search, so don't worry," replied Cyril quietly, and the two looked at each other and knew that it was so.
4992-23283-0016	4.495	Again he searched his own thoughts; nor ineffectually as before.	4992-41797-0018	9.155	There, in the cedar hollow, then, lived Olive Lord, an angry, resentful, little creature weighed down by a fierce sense of injury.
4992-23283-0001	2.71	Miss Milner's health is not good"!	4992-41797-0019	4.755	Olive's mournful black eyes met Nancy's sparkling brown ones.
4992-41797-0012	2.705	She is wild to know how to do things.	4992-41797-0020	7.49	Nancy's curly chestnut crop shone in the sun, and Olive's thick black plaits looked blacker by contrast.
4992-23283-0007	4.045	To ask any more questions of you, I believe, would be unfair.	4992-41797-0021	8.23	She's wonderful! More wonderful than anybody we've ever seen anywhere, and she draws better than the teacher in Charlestown!
4992-23283-0001	2.71	Miss Milner's health is not good"!	4992-41797-0022	6.45	She's older than I am, but so tiny and sad and shy that she seems like a child.
2830-3980-0001	3.945	They said to the Galatians: "You have no right to think highly of Paul.	2830-3979-0000	6.12	We want you to help us publish some leading work of Luther's for the general American market. Will you do it"?
2830-3980-0020	3.46	This is no sinful pride. It is holy pride.	2830-3979-0002	4.315	Let us begin with that: his Commentary on Galatians..".
2830-3980-0046	2.84	Was it not enough to say, "from God the Father"?	2830-3979-0003	8.085	The undertaking, which seemed so attractive when viewed as a literary task, proved a most difficult one, and at times became oppressive.
2830-3980-0012	3.42	The most they could claim is that they were sent by others.	2830-3979-0006	4.55	A word should now be said about the origin of Luther's Commentary on Galatians.
2830-3980-0013	4.145	He mentions the apostles first because they were appointed directly by God.	2830-3979-0008	9.44	In other words, these three men took down the lectures which Luther addressed to his students in the course of Galatians, and Roerer prepared the manuscript for the printer.
2830-3980-0013	4.145	He mentions the apostles first because they were appointed directly by God.	2830-3979-0009	8.35	It presents like no other of Luther's writings the central thought of Christianity, the justification of the sinner for the sake of Christ's merits alone.
2830-3980-0020	3.46	This is no sinful pride. It is holy pride.	2830-3979-0011	9.45	The Lord who has given us power to teach and to hear, let Him also give us the power to serve and to do". LUKE two
2094-142345-0025	3.595	Cold, is it, my darling? Bless your sweet face"!	2094-142345-0001	8.03	But the windows are patched with wooden panes, and the door, I think, is like the gate it is never opened.
2094-142345-0025	3.595	Cold, is it, my darling? Bless your sweet face"!	2094-142345-0005	9.09	Several clothes horses, a pillion, a spinning wheel, and an old box wide open and stuffed full of coloured rags.
2094-142345-0060	2.71	Oh, I've no doubt it's in capital order.	2094-142345-0021	5.335	That's the way with you that's the road you'd all like to go, headlongs to ruin.
2094-142345-0018	3.155	Who taught you to scrub a floor, I should like to know?	2094-142345-0034	7.99	And there's linen in the house as I could well spare you, for I've got lots o' sheeting and table clothing, and towelling, as isn't made up.
2094-142345-0026	2.825	She's going to put the ironing things away".	2094-142345-0036	6.915	Nay, dear aunt, you never heard me say that all people are called to forsake their work and their families.
2094-142345-0020	2.435	That's what you'd like to be doing, is it?	2094-142345-0039	6.28	I've strong assurance that no evil will happen to you and my uncle and the children from anything I've done.
2094-142345-0020	2.435	That's what you'd like to be doing, is it?	2094-142345-0043	7.35	By this time the two gentlemen had reached the palings and had got down from their horses: it was plain they meant to come in.
2094-142345-0032	3.24	I often heard her talk of you in the same sort of way.	2094-142345-0048	6.39	said Captain Donnithorne, seating himself where he could see along the short passage to the open dairy door.
2094-142345-0004	2.64	And what through the left hand window?	2094-142345-0049	6.125	No, sir, he isn't; he's gone to Rosseter to see mister West, the factor, about the wool.
2094-142345-0018	3.155	Who taught you to scrub a floor, I should like to know?	2094-142345-0051	5.31	No, thank you; I'll just look at the whelps and leave a message about them with your shepherd.
2094-142345-0060	2.71	Oh, I've no doubt it's in capital order.	2094-142345-0052	6.53	I must come another day and see your husband; I want to have a consultation with him about horses.
1995-1837-0009	3.76	The lagoon had been level with the dykes a week ago; and now?	1995-1836-0001	6	At last the Cotton Combine was to all appearances an assured fact and he was slated for the Senate.
1995-1837-0015	4.485	The squares of cotton, sharp edged, heavy, were just about to burst to bolls!	1995-1836-0003	7.965	She was not herself a notably intelligent woman; she greatly admired intelligence or whatever looked to her like intelligence in others.
1995-1837-0015	4.485	The squares of cotton, sharp edged, heavy, were just about to burst to bolls!	1995-1836-0006	7.715	She was therefore most agreeably surprised to hear mister Cresswell express himself so cordially as approving of Negro education.
1995-1837-0005	2.635	She was so strange and human a creature.	1995-1836-0008	6.985	I believe in the training of people to their highest capacity". The Englishman here heartily seconded him.
1995-1837-0000	3.865	He knew the Silver Fleece - his and Zora's - must be ruined.	1995-1836-0009	6.71	But," Cresswell added significantly, "capacity differs enormously between races".
1995-1826-0004	3.035	Might learn something useful down there".	1995-1836-0011	4.705	Positively heroic," added Cresswell, avoiding his sister's eyes.
1995-1837-0022	3.415	Up in the sick room Zora lay on the little white bed.	1995-1836-0014	9.045	Fortunately," said mister Vanderpool, "Northerners and Southerners are arriving at a better mutual understanding on most of these matters".
237-126133-0021	4.365	she asked impulsively, "I didn't believe you could persuade her, father".	237-126133-0003	6.56	Somehow, of all the days when the home feeling was the strongest, this day it seemed as if she could bear it no longer.
237-126133-0025	3.755	At last he came out of them, and wiped his face vigorously.	237-126133-0005	6.51	Oh, she's always at the piano," said Van. "She must be there now, somewhere," and then somebody laughed.
237-126133-0016	4.25	Oh no, Jasper; I must go by my very own self".	237-126133-0006	6.15	At this, the bundle opened suddenly, and - out popped Phronsie!
237-126133-0021	4.365	she asked impulsively, "I didn't believe you could persuade her, father".	237-126133-0007	8.68	But Polly couldn't speak; and if Jasper hadn't caught her just in time, she would have tumbled over backward from the stool, Phronsie and all!
237-126133-0025	3.755	At last he came out of them, and wiped his face vigorously.	237-126133-0010	6.24	Oh, you are the dearest and best mister King I ever saw! but how did you make mammy let her come"?
237-126133-0009	3.97	Now you'll stay," cried Van; "say, Polly, won't you".	237-126133-0011	6.71	Isn't he splendid"! cried Jasper in intense pride, swelling up. "Father knew how to do it".
237-126133-0018	4.095	Don't mind it, Polly," whispered Jasper; "twasn't her fault".	237-126133-0012	4.45	There, there," he said soothingly, patting her brown, fuzzy head.
237-126133-0016	4.25	Oh no, Jasper; I must go by my very own self".	237-126133-0013	6.815	I know," gasped Polly, controlling her sobs; "I won't - only - I can't thank you"!
237-126133-0025	3.755	At last he came out of them, and wiped his face vigorously.	237-126133-0014	6.79	asked Phronsie in intense interest slipping down out of Polly's arms, and crowding up close to Jasper's side.
237-126133-0025	3.755	At last he came out of them, and wiped his face vigorously.	237-126133-0015	9.34	Yes, all alone by himself," asserted Jasper, vehemently, and winking furiously to the others to stop their laughing; "he did now, truly, Phronsie".
237-126133-0009	3.97	Now you'll stay," cried Van; "say, Polly, won't you".	237-126133-0016	4.25	Oh no, Jasper; I must go by my very own self".
237-126133-0021	4.365	she asked impulsively, "I didn't believe you could persuade her, father".	237-126133-0017	6.21	There Jap, you've caught it," laughed Percy; while the others screamed at the sight of Jasper's face.
237-126133-0008	3.865	asked Phronsie, with her little face close to Polly's own.	237-126133-0018	4.095	Don't mind it, Polly," whispered Jasper; "twasn't her fault".
237-126133-0025	3.755	At last he came out of them, and wiped his face vigorously.	237-126133-0019	7.12	Dear me"! ejaculated the old gentleman, in the utmost amazement; "and such a time as I've had to get her here too"!
237-126133-0025	3.755	At last he came out of them, and wiped his face vigorously.	237-126133-0021	4.365	she asked impulsively, "I didn't believe you could persuade her, father".
237-126133-0021	4.365	she asked impulsively, "I didn't believe you could persuade her, father".	237-126133-0022	5.04	I didn't have any fears, if I worked it rightly," said the old gentleman complacently.
237-126133-0021	4.365	she asked impulsively, "I didn't believe you could persuade her, father".	237-126133-0023	6.675	he cried in high dudgeon; just as if he owned the whole of the Peppers, and could dispose of them all to suit his fancy!
237-126133-0021	4.365	she asked impulsively, "I didn't believe you could persuade her, father".	237-126133-0024	9.665	And the old gentleman was so delighted with his success, that he had to burst out into a series of short, happy bits of laughter, that occupied quite a space of time.
4507-16021-0040	3.925	One thinks one hears hydras talking.	4507-16021-0003	4.895	She has a son, theft, and a daughter, hunger.
4507-16021-0012	2.735	Why should one halt on the way?	4507-16021-0005	4.21	We have never understood this sort of objections.
4507-16021-0015	3.86	Since when has malady banished medicine?	4507-16021-0011	5.615	Why should one not explore everything, and study everything?
4507-16021-0000	2.59	Chapter one Origin.	4507-16021-0014	6.115	Now, when has horror ever excluded study?
4507-16021-0007	2.63	Slang makes one shudder"!	4507-16021-0024	5.14	Algebra, medicine, botany, have each their slang.
4507-16021-0041	2.975	It is unintelligible in the dark.	4507-16021-0025	9.215	To meet the needs of this conflict, wretchedness has invented a language of combat, which is slang.
4507-16021-0050	3.895	And you belong to that small class who are happy!	4507-16021-0033	5.545	Do we really know the mountain well when we are not acquainted with the cavern?
4507-16021-0058	3.11	The flame is the enemy of the wing.	4507-16021-0035	7.535	True history being a mixture of all things, the true historian mingles in everything.
4507-16021-0028	3.265	Even dialect, let that pass!	4507-16021-0036	5.435	Facts form one of these, and ideas the other.
4507-16021-0015	3.86	Since when has malady banished medicine?	4507-16021-0037	5.35	There it clothes itself in word masks, in metaphor rags.
4507-16021-0050	3.895	And you belong to that small class who are happy!	4507-16021-0045	4.89	It is so made, that everywhere we feel the sense of punishment.
4507-16021-0012	2.735	Why should one halt on the way?	4507-16021-0046	4.59	Each day has its own great grief or its little care.
4507-16021-0050	3.895	And you belong to that small class who are happy!	4507-16021-0048	5.215	This without reckoning in the pains of the heart. And so it goes on.
4507-16021-0050	3.895	And you belong to that small class who are happy!	4507-16021-0049	5.91	There is hardly one day out of a hundred which is wholly joyous and sunny.
4507-16021-0019	2.93	It is the language of wretchedness.	4507-16021-0051	6.17	In this world, evidently the vestibule of another, there are no fortunate.
4507-16021-0007	2.63	Slang makes one shudder"!	4507-16021-0052	6.275	The real human division is this: the luminous and the shady.
4507-16021-0005	4.21	We have never understood this sort of objections.	4507-16021-0053	8.095	To diminish the number of the shady, to augment the number of the luminous,-that is the object.
4507-16021-0029	3.87	To this we reply in one word, only.	4507-16021-0054	4.315	That is why we cry: Education! science!
4507-16021-0041	2.975	It is unintelligible in the dark.	4507-16021-0055	7.225	To teach reading, means to light the fire; every syllable spelled out sparkles.
4507-16021-0040	3.925	One thinks one hears hydras talking.	4507-16021-0056	6.345	However, he who says light does not, necessarily, say joy.
4507-16021-0038	3.885	In this guise it becomes horrible.	4507-16021-0057	4.61	People suffer in the light; excess burns.
4507-16021-0015	3.86	Since when has malady banished medicine?	4507-16021-0059	6.205	To burn without ceasing to fly, therein lies the marvel of genius.
8555-284447-0020	4.09	The goat's warlike spirit was roused by this successful attack.	8555-284447-0000	9.605	Then he rushed down stairs into the courtyard, shouting loudly for his soldiers and threatening to patch everybody in his dominions if the sailorman was not recaptured.
8555-284447-0003	4.415	But Captain Bill made no such attempt, knowing it would be useless.	8555-284447-0001	8.61	Hold him fast, my men, and as soon as I've had my coffee and oatmeal I'll take him to the Room of the Great Knife and patch him".
8555-284447-0022	3.56	I had a notion it was you, mate, as saved me from the knife.	8555-284447-0002	8.025	I wouldn't mind a cup of coffee myself," said Captain Bill. "I've had considerable exercise this morning and I'm all ready for breakfast".
8555-284447-0009	3.275	Mornin', girls; hope ye feel as well as ye look".	8555-284447-0003	4.415	But Captain Bill made no such attempt, knowing it would be useless.
8555-284447-0020	4.09	The goat's warlike spirit was roused by this successful attack.	8555-284447-0004	5.485	As soon as they entered the Room of the Great Knife the Boolooroo gave a yell of disappointment.
8555-284447-0020	4.09	The goat's warlike spirit was roused by this successful attack.	8555-284447-0005	6.83	The Room of the Great Knife was high and big, and around it ran rows of benches for the spectators to sit upon.
8555-284449-0005	2.555	When he finished she said cheerfully:	8555-284447-0007	6.365	Therefore her Majesty paid no attention to anyone and no one paid any attention to her.
8555-284447-0020	4.09	The goat's warlike spirit was roused by this successful attack.	8555-284447-0008	8.39	Rich jewels of blue stones glittered upon their persons and the royal ladies were fully as gorgeous as they were haughty and overbearing.
8555-284447-0020	4.09	The goat's warlike spirit was roused by this successful attack.	8555-284447-0013	9.04	Why, you said to fetch the first living creature we met, and that was this billygoat," replied the Captain, panting hard as he held fast to one of the goat's horns.
8555-284447-0020	4.09	The goat's warlike spirit was roused by this successful attack.	8555-284447-0014	8.47	The idea of patching Captain Bill to a goat was vastly amusing to him, and the more he thought of it the more he roared with laughter.
8555-284447-0020	4.09	The goat's warlike spirit was roused by this successful attack.	8555-284447-0018	5.46	At once the goat gave a leap, escaped from the soldiers and with bowed head rushed upon the Boolooroo.
8555-284447-0003	4.415	But Captain Bill made no such attempt, knowing it would be useless.	8555-284447-0020	4.09	The goat's warlike spirit was roused by this successful attack.
8555-284447-0022	3.56	I had a notion it was you, mate, as saved me from the knife.	8555-284447-0023	7.155	I couldn't shiver much, bein' bound so tight, but when I'm loose I mean to have jus' one good shiver to relieve my feelin's".
8555-292519-0013	4.185	That was but rustling of dripping plants in the dark.	8555-284447-0024	4.635	Come and get the Boolooroo," she said, going toward the benches.
8230-279154-0003	3.195	And what sort of evidence is logically possible?	8230-279154-0000	8.805	The analysis of knowledge will occupy us until the end of the thirteenth lecture, and is the most difficult part of our whole enterprise.
8230-279154-0032	3.88	It is this that is of interest to theory of knowledge.	8230-279154-0005	7.72	All that I am doing is to use its logical tenability as a help in the analysis of what occurs when we remember.
8230-279154-0003	3.195	And what sort of evidence is logically possible?	8230-279154-0006	7.51	The behaviourist, who attempts to make psychology a record of behaviour, has to trust his memory in making the record.
8230-279154-0008	3.62	But I do not think such an inference is warranted.	8230-279154-0011	6.25	Some images, like some sensations, feel very familiar, while others feel strange.
8230-279154-0003	3.195	And what sort of evidence is logically possible?	8230-279154-0014	7.94	I come now to the other characteristic which memory images must have in order to account for our knowledge of the past.
8230-279154-0003	3.195	And what sort of evidence is logically possible?	8230-279154-0015	8.05	They must have some characteristic which makes us regard them as referring to more or less remote portions of the past.
8230-279154-0003	3.195	And what sort of evidence is logically possible?	8230-279154-0017	7.93	There may be a specific feeling which could be called the feeling of "pastness," especially where immediate memory is concerned.
8230-279154-0003	3.195	And what sort of evidence is logically possible?	8230-279154-0020	7.835	If we had retained the "subject" or "act" in knowledge, the whole problem of memory would have been comparatively simple.
8230-279154-0003	3.195	And what sort of evidence is logically possible?	8230-279154-0021	6.56	Remembering has to be a present occurrence in some way resembling, or related to, what is remembered.
8230-279154-0012	3.64	Familiarity is a feeling capable of degrees.	8230-279154-0022	6.44	Some points may be taken as fixed, and such as any theory of memory must arrive at.
8230-279154-0032	3.88	It is this that is of interest to theory of knowledge.	8230-279154-0023	6.265	In this case, as in most others, what may be taken as certain in advance is rather vague.
8230-279154-0008	3.62	But I do not think such an inference is warranted.	8230-279154-0024	6.34	The first of our vague but indubitable data is that there is knowledge of the past.
8230-279154-0032	3.88	It is this that is of interest to theory of knowledge.	8230-279154-0026	9.3	This distinction is vital to the understanding of memory. But it is not so easy to carry out in practice as it is to draw in theory.
8230-279154-0003	3.195	And what sort of evidence is logically possible?	8230-279154-0029	8.54	The fact that a man can recite a poem does not show that he remembers any previous occasion on which he has recited or read it.
8230-279154-0008	3.62	But I do not think such an inference is warranted.	8230-279154-0030	7.28	Semon's two books, mentioned in an earlier lecture, do not touch knowledge memory at all closely.
8230-279154-0012	3.64	Familiarity is a feeling capable of degrees.	8230-279154-0035	7.555	Thus no knowledge as to the past is to be derived from the feeling of familiarity alone.
8230-279154-0003	3.195	And what sort of evidence is logically possible?	8230-279154-0039	4.59	This knowledge is memory in one sense, though in another it is not.
7021-85628-0000	3.02	But Anders cared nothing about that.	7021-79740-0001	5.995	Della had a young sister named Maria, and a cousin whose name was Jane.
7021-85628-0019	3.255	With one jump Anders got out of his chair.	7021-79740-0002	9.225	Now Delia contrived to obtain a great influence and ascendency over the minds of the children by means of these dolls.
7021-79740-0009	3.635	They were now playing with their dolls in the parlor.	7021-79740-0003	4.985	To give an idea of these conversations I will report one of them in full.
7021-79740-0012	3.26	said she, pointing to the playthings; "see!	7021-79740-0004	6.465	You have come, Andella (Andella was the name of Jane's doll), to make Rosalie a visit.
7021-85628-0019	3.255	With one jump Anders got out of his chair.	7021-79740-0006	5.965	I expect you have been a very good girl, Andella, since you were here last".
7021-79740-0012	3.26	said she, pointing to the playthings; "see!	7021-79740-0007	6.99	Then, turning to Jane, she asked, in a somewhat altered tone, "Has she been a good girl, Jane"?
7021-79740-0009	3.635	They were now playing with their dolls in the parlor.	7021-79740-0013	7.365	Put these playthings all away quick, and carefully, and we will not let them know any thing about your leaving them out".
61-70970-0016	4.37	We will go out together to the bower; there is a way down to the court from my window.	61-70968-0000	4.905	He began a confused complaint against the wizard, who had vanished behind the curtain on the left.
61-70968-0012	2.61	Cries of: "A Nottingham! A Nottingham"!	61-70968-0003	4.315	He was like unto my father, in a way, and yet was not my father.
61-70970-0009	3.405	Tis late; and I go myself within a short space.	61-70968-0005	5.07	This was so sweet a lady, sir, and in some manner I do think she died.
61-70968-0018	2.405	So I did push this fellow".	61-70968-0009	4.51	Like as not, young master, though I am an old man".
61-70970-0033	3.42	Truly such a horse should be worth much in Nottingham Fair!	61-70968-0010	8.295	Forthwith all ran to the opening of the tent to see what might be amiss; but Master Will, who peeped out first, needed no more than one glance.
61-70970-0016	4.37	We will go out together to the bower; there is a way down to the court from my window.	61-70968-0011	6.375	He gave way to the others very readily and retreated unperceived by the Squire and Mistress Fitzooth to the rear of the tent.
61-70970-0019	3.78	At last all was quiet and black in the courtyard of Gamewell.	61-70968-0013	4.45	Before them fled the stroller and his three sons, capless and terrified.
61-70968-0006	2.935	But then the picture was gone as quickly as it came".	61-70968-0014	7.485	What is the tumult and rioting"? cried out the Squire, authoritatively, and he blew twice on a silver whistle which hung at his belt.
61-70968-0036	2.934938	George Montfichet will never forget this day.	61-70968-0015	5.375	Nay, we refused their request most politely, most noble," said the little stroller.
61-70970-0007	4.485	He was in deep converse with the clerk, and entered the hall holding him by the arm.	61-70968-0017	5.11	I could not see my boy injured, excellence, for but doing his duty as one of Cumberland's sons.
61-70970-0023	3.705	Be not so foolish, friend," said Fitzooth, crossly.	61-70968-0019	5.475	It is enough," said George Gamewell, sharply, and he turned upon the crowd.
61-70968-0025	4.41	Come to me, men, here, here"! He raised his voice still louder.	61-70968-0020	5.105	Shame on you, citizens," cried he; "I blush for my fellows of Nottingham.
61-70968-0048	3.02	And Henry might return to England at any moment.	61-70968-0022	4.67	Tis fine for you to talk, old man," answered the lean, sullen apprentice.
61-70970-0033	3.42	Truly such a horse should be worth much in Nottingham Fair!	61-70968-0023	5.025	But I wrestled with this fellow and do know that he played unfairly in the second bout.
61-70970-0032	3.135	enquired Robin, with his suspicions still upon him.	61-70968-0024	6.025	spoke the Squire, losing all patience; "and it was to you that I gave another purse in consolation!
61-70970-0003	3.835	If, for a whim, you beggar yourself, I cannot stay you.	61-70968-0025	4.41	Come to me, men, here, here"! He raised his voice still louder.
61-70970-0040	4.165	They regained their apartment, apparently without disturbing the household of Gamewell.	61-70968-0026	4.92	The strollers took their part in it with hearty zest now that they had some chance of beating off their foes.
61-70970-0016	4.37	We will go out together to the bower; there is a way down to the court from my window.	61-70968-0027	6.87	Robin and the little tumbler between them tried to force the Squire to stand back, and very valiantly did these two comport themselves.
61-70968-0046	3.55	Nottingham Castle was reached, and admittance was demanded.	61-70968-0030	5.685	Now, be silent, on your lives," he began; but the captured apprentice set up an instant shout.
61-70968-0029	3.495	The Squire helped to thrust them all in and entered swiftly himself.	61-70968-0032	4.28	He felt for and found the wizard's black cloth. The Squire was quite out of breath.
61-70970-0016	4.37	We will go out together to the bower; there is a way down to the court from my window.	61-70968-0033	5.685	Thrusting open the proper entrance of the tent, Robin suddenly rushed forth with his burden, with a great shout.
61-70970-0016	4.37	We will go out together to the bower; there is a way down to the court from my window.	61-70968-0035	7.95	Taking advantage of this, the Squire's few men redoubled their efforts, and, encouraged by Robin's and the little stroller's cries, fought their way to him.
61-70968-0036	2.934938	George Montfichet will never forget this day.	61-70968-0037	4.315	What is your name, lording"? asked the little stroller, presently.
61-70970-0022	3.97	Robin entered the hut, dragging the unwilling esquire after him.	61-70968-0041	6.825	I like you, Will; you are the second Will that I have met and liked within two days; is there a sign in that"?
61-70968-0003	4.315	He was like unto my father, in a way, and yet was not my father.	61-70968-0043	6.735	Friends," said Montfichet, faintly, to the wrestlers, "bear us escort so far as the Sheriff's house.
61-70970-0013	4.35	There was no chance to alter his sleeping room to one nearer to Gamewell's chamber.	61-70968-0047	4.775	Master Monceux, the Sheriff of Nottingham, was mightily put about when told of the rioting.
61-70968-0048	3.02	And Henry might return to England at any moment.	61-70968-0049	8.25	Have your will, child, if the boy also wills it," Montfichet answered, feeling too ill to oppose anything very strongly just then.
61-70968-0042	2.785	Montfichet called out for Robin to give him an arm.	61-70968-0050	5.58	He made an effort to hide his condition from them all, and Robin felt his fingers tighten upon his arm.
61-70970-0030	3.24	Save me, masters, but you startled me rarely"!	61-70968-0053	4.22	He is my esquire, excellency," returned Robin, with dignity.
61-70970-0040	4.165	They regained their apartment, apparently without disturbing the household of Gamewell.	61-70968-0054	7.86	Mistress Fitzooth had been carried off by the Sheriff's daughter and her maids as soon as they had entered the house, so that Robin alone had the care of Montfichet.
61-70968-0012	2.61	Cries of: "A Nottingham! A Nottingham"!	61-70968-0057	5.065	These escapades are not for old Gamewell, lad; his day has come to twilight.
61-70968-0048	3.02	And Henry might return to England at any moment.	61-70968-0061	5.53	You are a worthy leech, Will," presently whispered Robin. "The wine has worked a marvel.
8224-274384-0003	3.87	or hath he given us any gift?	8224-274384-0002	9.815	They informed the English parliament of this unexpected incident, and assured them that they had entered into no private treaty with the king.
8224-274384-0003	3.87	or hath he given us any gift?	8224-274384-0005	8.745	Another preacher, after reproaching him to his face with his misgovernment, ordered this psalm to be sung:
8224-274384-0003	3.87	or hath he given us any gift?	8224-274384-0006	6.81	The king stood up, and called for that psalm which begins with these words,
8224-274384-0003	3.87	or hath he given us any gift?	8224-274384-0007	6.23	Have mercy, Lord, on me, I pray; For men would me devour".
8224-274384-0003	3.87	or hath he given us any gift?	8224-274384-0009	4.805	The parliament and the Scots laid their proposals before the king.
8224-274384-0003	3.87	or hath he given us any gift?	8224-274384-0013	5.44	His death, in this conjuncture, was a public misfortune.
6829-68771-0035	4.39	Will you leave me alone in my own room, or must I go away to escape you"?	6829-68769-0001	9.315	It was a serious crime indeed, mister Watson told them, and Tom Gates bade fair to serve a lengthy term in state's prison as a consequence of his rash act.
6829-68769-0046	2.57	You're foolish. Why should you do all this"?	6829-68769-0003	4.215	It was a deliberate theft from his employers to protect a girl he loved.
6829-68769-0007	3.865	But under the circumstances I doubt if such an arrangement could be made".	6829-68769-0004	7.145	But they could not have proven a case against Lucy, if she was innocent, and all their threats of arresting her were probably mere bluff.
6829-68769-0044	3.225	It has cost me twice sixty dollars in annoyance".	6829-68769-0005	6.72	He was soft hearted and impetuous," said Beth; "and, being in love, he didn't stop to count the cost".
6829-68769-0022	4.115	We have heard something of your story," said Kenneth, "and are interested in it.	6829-68769-0006	7.195	If the prosecution were withdrawn and the case settled with the victim of the forged check, then the young man would be allowed his freedom.
6829-68769-0022	4.115	We have heard something of your story," said Kenneth, "and are interested in it.	6829-68769-0009	4.22	They were received in the little office by a man named Markham, who was the jailer.
6829-68769-0003	4.215	It was a deliberate theft from his employers to protect a girl he loved.	6829-68769-0011	4.685	I'm running for Representative on the Republican ticket," said Kenneth, quietly.
6829-68769-0039	4.045	He looked up rather ungraciously, but motioned them to be seated.	6829-68769-0012	4.295	Oh, say! that's different," observed Markham, altering his demeanor.
6829-68769-0003	4.215	It was a deliberate theft from his employers to protect a girl he loved.	6829-68769-0015	6.525	Sometimes I'm that yearning for a smoke I'm nearly crazy, an' I don't know which is worst, dying one way or another.
6829-68769-0037	2.53	I've seen lots of that kind in my day.	6829-68769-0016	4.12	He unlocked the door, and called: "Here's visitors, Tom".
6829-68771-0028	3.555	She even seemed mildly amused at the attention she attracted.	6829-68769-0020	5.125	Sit down, please," said Gates, in a cheerful and pleasant voice. "There's a bench here".
6829-68769-0002	3.075	I can't see it in that light," said the old lawyer.	6829-68769-0021	7.895	A fresh, wholesome looking boy, was Tom Gates, with steady gray eyes, an intelligent forehead, but a sensitive, rather weak mouth.
6829-68769-0009	4.22	They were received in the little office by a man named Markham, who was the jailer.	6829-68769-0022	4.115	We have heard something of your story," said Kenneth, "and are interested in it.
6829-68771-0028	3.555	She even seemed mildly amused at the attention she attracted.	6829-68769-0023	4.89	I didn't stop to think whether it was foolish or not. I did it; and I'm glad I did".
6829-68769-0007	3.865	But under the circumstances I doubt if such an arrangement could be made".	6829-68769-0025	5.735	Then Rogers wouldn't do anything but lead her around, and wait upon her, and the place went to rack and ruin".
6829-68769-0051	3.545	There was a grim smile of amusement on his shrewd face.	6829-68769-0026	4.64	He spoke simply, but paced up and down the narrow cell in front of them.
6829-68769-0012	4.295	Oh, say! that's different," observed Markham, altering his demeanor.	6829-68769-0030	4.91	I was bookkeeper, so it was easy to get a blank check and forge the signature.
6829-68769-0037	2.53	I've seen lots of that kind in my day.	6829-68769-0031	5.555	As regards my robbing the company, I'll say that I saved them a heavy loss one day.
6829-68769-0007	3.865	But under the circumstances I doubt if such an arrangement could be made".	6829-68769-0032	5.72	I discovered and put out a fire that would have destroyed the whole plant. But Marshall never even thanked me.
6829-68769-0019	2.665	Sorry we haven't any reception room in the jail.	6829-68769-0033	4.02	It was better for him to think the girl unfeeling than to know the truth.
6829-68769-0019	2.665	Sorry we haven't any reception room in the jail.	6829-68769-0034	6.055	I'm going to see mister Marshall," said Kenneth, "and discover what I can do to assist you". "Thank you, sir.
6829-68771-0035	4.39	Will you leave me alone in my own room, or must I go away to escape you"?	6829-68769-0036	5.555	They left him then, for the jailer arrived to unlock the door, and escort them to the office.
6829-68769-0017	3.545	Worse, Tom; worse 'n ever," replied the jailer, gloomily.	6829-68769-0039	4.045	He looked up rather ungraciously, but motioned them to be seated.
6829-68771-0028	3.555	She even seemed mildly amused at the attention she attracted.	6829-68769-0040	4.77	Some girl has been here twice to interview my men and I have refused to admit her.
6829-68769-0012	4.295	Oh, say! that's different," observed Markham, altering his demeanor.	6829-68769-0049	7.4	He detested the grasping disposition that would endeavor to take advantage of his evident desire to help young Gates.
6829-68769-0010	3.14	We wish to talk with him," answered Kenneth. "Talk!	6829-68769-0052	4.6	He might have had that forged check for the face of it, if he'd been sharp.
6829-68769-0051	3.545	There was a grim smile of amusement on his shrewd face.	6829-68769-0053	6.36	And to think we can save all that misery and despair by the payment of a hundred and fifty dollars!
5142-33396-0015	4.31	As our boat flashed down the rollers into the water I made this song and sang it:	5142-36586-0003	5.055	But this subject will be more properly discussed when we treat of the different races of mankind.
3570-5694-0019	3.755	But the general distinction is not on that account to be overlooked.	3570-5696-0002	7.51	Other circumstances permitting, that instinct disposes men to look with favor upon productive efficiency and on whatever is of human use.
3570-5694-0012	3.205	There is a more or less elaborate system of rank and grades.	3570-5696-0004	4.7	The salient features of this development of domestic service have already been indicated.
3570-5694-0012	3.205	There is a more or less elaborate system of rank and grades.	3570-5696-0006	4.16	As used in the speech of everyday life the word carries an undertone of deprecation.
3570-5694-0019	3.755	But the general distinction is not on that account to be overlooked.	3570-5696-0007	9.5	The use of the word "waste" as a technical term, therefore, implies no deprecation of the motives or of the ends sought by the consumer under this canon of conspicuous waste.
3570-5696-0006	4.16	As used in the speech of everyday life the word carries an undertone of deprecation.	3570-5696-0008	7.26	But it is, on other grounds, worth noting that the term "waste" in the language of everyday life implies deprecation of what is characterized as wasteful.
3570-5694-0012	3.205	There is a more or less elaborate system of rank and grades.	3570-5696-0009	8.86	In strict accuracy nothing should be included under the head of conspicuous waste but such expenditure as is incurred on the ground of an invidious pecuniary comparison.
3570-5694-0012	3.205	There is a more or less elaborate system of rank and grades.	3570-5696-0010	7.57	An article may be useful and wasteful both, and its utility to the consumer may be made up of use and waste in the most varying proportions.
2830-3980-0042	3.02	The world brands this a pernicious doctrine.	2830-3980-0005	6.45	Do you suppose that God for the sake of a few Lutheran heretics would disown His entire Church?
2830-3980-0071	3.96	We think that by some little work or merit we can dismiss sin.	2830-3980-0006	6.41	Against these boasting, false apostles, Paul boldly defends his apostolic authority and ministry.
2830-3980-0046	2.84	Was it not enough to say, "from God the Father"?	2830-3980-0008	4.84	Paul takes pride in his ministry, not to his own praise but to the praise of God.
2830-3980-0028	3.54	This should go far in shutting the mouths of the false apostles.	2830-3980-0010	6.525	Either He calls ministers through the agency of men, or He calls them directly as He called the prophets and apostles.
2830-3980-0071	3.96	We think that by some little work or merit we can dismiss sin.	2830-3980-0011	5.525	Paul declares that the false apostles were called or sent neither by men, nor by man.
2830-3980-0028	3.54	This should go far in shutting the mouths of the false apostles.	2830-3980-0013	4.145	He mentions the apostles first because they were appointed directly by God.
2830-3980-0017	3.665	When I was a young man I thought Paul was making too much of his call.	2830-3980-0019	7.015	I knew nothing of the doctrine of faith because we were taught sophistry instead of certainty, and nobody understood spiritual boasting.
2830-3980-0021	2.91	and God the Father, who raised him from the dead.	2830-3980-0023	6.16	These perverters of the righteousness of Christ resist the Father and the Son, and the works of them both.
2830-3980-0020	3.46	This is no sinful pride. It is holy pride.	2830-3980-0025	8.795	By His resurrection Christ won the victory over law, sin, flesh, world, devil, death, hell, and every evil.
2830-3980-0042	3.02	The world brands this a pernicious doctrine.	2830-3980-0029	9.075	Although the brethren with me are not apostles like myself, yet they are all of one mind with me, think, write, and teach as I do".
2830-3980-0000	3.73	In every way they sought to undermine the authority of Saint Paul.	2830-3980-0030	5.25	They do not go where the enemies of the Gospel predominate. They go where the Christians are.
2830-3980-0000	3.73	In every way they sought to undermine the authority of Saint Paul.	2830-3980-0031	8.485	Why do they not invade the Catholic provinces and preach their doctrine to godless princes, bishops, and doctors, as we have done by the help of God?
2830-3980-0042	3.02	The world brands this a pernicious doctrine.	2830-3980-0032	7.22	We look for that reward which "eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath entered into the heart of man".
2830-3980-0000	3.73	In every way they sought to undermine the authority of Saint Paul.	2830-3980-0036	5.765	Wherever the means of grace are found, there is the Holy Church, even though Antichrist reigns there.
2830-3980-0058	2.69	Mohammed also speaks highly of Christ.	2830-3980-0037	6.42	So much for the title of the epistle. Now follows the greeting of the apostle. VERSE three.
2830-3980-0042	3.02	The world brands this a pernicious doctrine.	2830-3980-0038	5.54	Grace be to you, and peace, from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ.
2830-3980-0000	3.73	In every way they sought to undermine the authority of Saint Paul.	2830-3980-0039	5.195	The terms of grace and peace are common terms with Paul and are now pretty well understood.
2830-3980-0064	2.88	How may we obtain remission of our sins?	2830-3980-0041	4.89	Grace involves the remission of sins, peace, and a happy conscience.
2830-3980-0024	3.935	In this whole epistle Paul treats of the resurrection of Christ.	2830-3980-0047	7.865	To do so is to lose God altogether because God becomes intolerable when we seek to measure and to comprehend His infinite majesty.
2830-3980-0071	3.96	We think that by some little work or merit we can dismiss sin.	2830-3980-0050	7.475	Did not Christ Himself say: "I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me"?
2830-3980-0001	3.945	They said to the Galatians: "You have no right to think highly of Paul.	2830-3980-0051	6.44	When you argue about the nature of God apart from the question of justification, you may be as profound as you like.
2830-3980-0046	2.84	Was it not enough to say, "from God the Father"?	2830-3980-0052	4.88	We are to hear Christ, who has been appointed by the Father as our divine Teacher.
2830-3980-0003	2.48	Paul came later and is beneath us.	2830-3980-0053	5.015	At the same time, Paul confirms our creed, "that Christ is very God".
2830-3980-0071	3.96	We think that by some little work or merit we can dismiss sin.	2830-3980-0055	7.335	To bestow peace and grace lies in the province of God, who alone can create these blessings. The angels cannot.
2830-3980-0060	2.675	He never loses sight of the purpose of his epistle.	2830-3980-0056	5.35	Otherwise Paul should have written: "Grace from God the Father, and peace from our Lord Jesus Christ".
2830-3980-0040	2.62	The greeting of the Apostle is refreshing.	2830-3980-0057	8.07	The Arians took Christ for a noble and perfect creature, superior even to the angels, because by Him God created heaven and earth.
2830-3979-0012	3.625	The Word of our God shall stand forever.	2830-3980-0061	7.12	Not gold, or silver, or paschal lambs, or an angel, but Himself. What for?
2830-3980-0034	2.97	These means cannot be contaminated.	2830-3980-0062	5.44	Not for a crown, or a kingdom, or our goodness, but for our sins.
2830-3980-0045	3.51	Men Should Not Speculate About the Nature of God	2830-3980-0063	5.415	Underscore these words, for they are full of comfort for sore consciences.
2830-3980-0042	3.02	The world brands this a pernicious doctrine.	2830-3980-0065	6.515	Paul answers: "The man who is named Jesus Christ and the Son of God gave himself for our sins".
2830-3980-0021	2.91	and God the Father, who raised him from the dead.	2830-3980-0066	6.085	Since Christ was given for our sins it stands to reason that they cannot be put away by our own efforts.
2830-3980-0071	3.96	We think that by some little work or merit we can dismiss sin.	2830-3980-0067	8.13	This sentence also defines our sins as great, so great, in fact, that the whole world could not make amends for a single sin.
2830-3980-0045	3.51	Men Should Not Speculate About the Nature of God	2830-3980-0068	5	The greatness of the ransom, Christ, the Son of God, indicates this.
2830-3980-0040	2.62	The greeting of the Apostle is refreshing.	2830-3980-0069	5.555063	The vicious character of sin is brought out by the words "who gave himself for our sins".
2830-3980-0042	3.02	The world brands this a pernicious doctrine.	2830-3980-0072	4.855	This passage, then, bears out the fact that all men are sold under sin.
2830-3980-0060	2.675	He never loses sight of the purpose of his epistle.	2830-3980-0074	5.7	This attitude is universal and particularly developed in those who consider themselves better than others.
2830-3980-0042	3.02	The world brands this a pernicious doctrine.	2830-3980-0075	5.79	But the real significance and comfort of the words "for our sins" is lost upon them.
2830-3980-0046	2.84	Was it not enough to say, "from God the Father"?	2830-3980-0076	4.81	On the other hand, we are not to regard them as so terrible that we must despair.
5105-28241-0014	2.995	Another circumstance was most remarkable.	5105-28233-0000	4.51	Length of service: Fourteen years, three months, and five days.
5105-28240-0018	2.885	You will take me on board, count, will you not"?	5105-28233-0001	4.49	He seemed born to please without being conscious of the power he possessed.
5105-28240-0018	2.885	You will take me on board, count, will you not"?	5105-28233-0002	8.285	It must be owned, and no one was more ready to confess it than himself, that his literary attainments were by no means of a high order.
5105-28233-0001	4.49	He seemed born to please without being conscious of the power he possessed.	5105-28233-0004	4.735	Once, in action, he was leading a detachment of infantry through an intrenchment.
5105-28241-0003	3.98	Steam up and canvas spread, the schooner started eastwards.	5105-28233-0006	5.505	No cathedral - not even Burgos itself - could vie with the church at Montmartre.
2961-961-0005	3.775	Some poems of Solon were recited by the boys.	2961-961-0000	4.665	Socrates begins the Timaeus with a summary of the Republic.
2961-961-0005	3.775	Some poems of Solon were recited by the boys.	2961-961-0001	9.185	And now he desires to see the ideal State set in motion; he would like to know how she behaved in some great struggle.
2961-961-0005	3.775	Some poems of Solon were recited by the boys.	2961-961-0003	4.73	I will, if Timaeus approves'. 'I approve.
2961-961-0005	3.775	Some poems of Solon were recited by the boys.	2961-961-0006	4.6	And what was the subject of the poem'? said the person who made the remark.
2961-961-0005	3.775	Some poems of Solon were recited by the boys.	2961-961-0007	8.505	The subject was a very noble one; he described the most famous action in which the Athenian people were ever engaged.
2961-961-0005	3.775	Some poems of Solon were recited by the boys.	2961-961-0008	7.155	But the memory of their exploits has passed away owing to the lapse of time and the extinction of the actors.
2961-961-0005	3.775	Some poems of Solon were recited by the boys.	2961-961-0009	5.705	Tell us,' said the other, 'the whole story, and where Solon heard the story.
2961-961-0005	3.775	Some poems of Solon were recited by the boys.	2961-961-0010	7.83	But in Egypt the traditions of our own and other lands are by us registered for ever in our temples.
2961-961-0005	3.775	Some poems of Solon were recited by the boys.	2961-961-0011	7.815	The genealogies which you have recited to us out of your own annals, Solon, are a mere children's story.
2961-961-0005	3.775	Some poems of Solon were recited by the boys.	2961-961-0013	5.12	Solon marvelled, and desired to be informed of the particulars.
2961-961-0005	3.775	Some poems of Solon were recited by the boys.	2961-961-0014	9.565	Nine thousand years have elapsed since she founded yours, and eight thousand since she founded ours, as our annals record.
2961-961-0005	3.775	Some poems of Solon were recited by the boys.	2961-961-0015	6.815	Many laws exist among us which are the counterpart of yours as they were in the olden time.
2961-961-0005	3.775	Some poems of Solon were recited by the boys.	2961-961-0016	7.815	I will briefly describe them to you, and you shall read the account of them at your leisure in the sacred registers.
2961-961-0005	3.775	Some poems of Solon were recited by the boys.	2961-961-0017	9.73	Observe again, what care the law took in the pursuit of wisdom, searching out the deep things of the world, and applying them to the use of man.
2961-961-0005	3.775	Some poems of Solon were recited by the boys.	2961-961-0018	5.29	The most famous of them all was the overthrow of the island of Atlantis.
2961-961-0005	3.775	Some poems of Solon were recited by the boys.	2961-961-0020	6.125	This is the explanation of the shallows which are found in that part of the Atlantic ocean.
2961-961-0005	3.775	Some poems of Solon were recited by the boys.	2961-961-0021	4.94	But I would not speak at the time, because I wanted to refresh my memory.
1995-1837-0015	4.485	The squares of cotton, sharp edged, heavy, were just about to burst to bolls!	1995-1837-0001	8.73	It was the first great sorrow of his life; it was not so much the loss of the cotton itself - but the fantasy, the hopes, the dreams built around it.
1995-1837-0015	4.485	The squares of cotton, sharp edged, heavy, were just about to burst to bolls!	1995-1837-0003	7.36	The revelation of his love lighted and brightened slowly till it flamed like a sunrise over him and left him in burning wonder.
1995-1826-0008	2.895	Some others, too; big cotton county".	1995-1837-0004	6.36	He panted to know if she, too, knew, or knew and cared not, or cared and knew not.
1995-1837-0005	2.635	She was so strange and human a creature.	1995-1837-0007	8.8	Then of a sudden, at midday, the sun shot out, hot and still; no breath of air stirred; the sky was like blue steel; the earth steamed.
1995-1837-0009	3.76	The lagoon had been level with the dykes a week ago; and now?	1995-1837-0012	8.245	He splashed and stamped along, farther and farther onward until he neared the rampart of the clearing, and put foot upon the tree bridge.
1995-1826-0003	3.09	Better go," he had counselled, sententiously.	1995-1837-0016	7.19	For one long moment he paused, stupid, agape with utter amazement, then leaned dizzily against a tree.
1995-1837-0013	3.195	Then he looked down. The lagoon was dry.	1995-1837-0019	5.38	He sat down weak, bewildered, and one thought was uppermost - Zora!
1995-1836-0007	3.435	But you believe in some education"? asked Mary Taylor.	1995-1837-0024	5.385	For a while she lay in her chair, in happy, dreamy pleasure at sun and bird and tree.
1995-1836-0007	3.435	But you believe in some education"? asked Mary Taylor.	1995-1837-0025	9.505062	She rose with a fleeting glance, gathered the shawl round her, then gliding forward, wavering, tremulous, slipped across the road and into the swamp.
1995-1837-0021	3.09	The hope and dream of harvest was upon the land.	1995-1837-0026	8.095	She had been born within its borders; within its borders she had lived and grown, and within its borders she had met her love.
1995-1826-0003	3.09	Better go," he had counselled, sententiously.	1995-1837-0027	6.705	On she hurried until, sweeping down to the lagoon and the island, lo! the cotton lay before her!
1995-1826-0025	3.295	Some time you'll tell me, please, won't you"?	1995-1837-0029	5.58	He darted through the trees and paused, a tall man strongly but slimly made.
5639-40744-0010	4.12	It is the only amends I ask of you for the wrong you have done me".	5639-40744-0002	8.91	Rodolfo and his companions, with their faces muffled in their cloaks, stared rudely and insolently at the mother, the daughter, and the servant maid.
5639-40744-0010	4.12	It is the only amends I ask of you for the wrong you have done me".	5639-40744-0005	5.645	Finally, the one party went off exulting, and the other was left in desolation and woe.
5639-40744-0010	4.12	It is the only amends I ask of you for the wrong you have done me".	5639-40744-0006	8.045	Rodolfo arrived at his own house without any impediment, and Leocadia's parents reached theirs heart broken and despairing.
5639-40744-0010	4.12	It is the only amends I ask of you for the wrong you have done me".	5639-40744-0007	5.825	Meanwhile Rodolfo had Leocadia safe in his custody, and in his own apartment.
5639-40744-0011	2.665	She found the door, but it was locked outside.	5639-40744-0010	4.12	It is the only amends I ask of you for the wrong you have done me".
5639-40744-0011	2.665	She found the door, but it was locked outside.	5639-40744-0012	8.595	She succeeded in opening the window; and the moonlight shone in so brightly, that she could distinguish the colour of some damask hangings in the room.
5639-40744-0010	4.12	It is the only amends I ask of you for the wrong you have done me".	5639-40744-0013	6.865	She saw that the bed was gilded, and so rich, that it seemed that of a prince rather than of a private gentleman.
5639-40744-0010	4.12	It is the only amends I ask of you for the wrong you have done me".	5639-40744-0014	7.72	Among other things on which she cast her eyes was a small crucifix of solid silver, standing on a cabinet near the window.
5639-40744-0011	2.665	She found the door, but it was locked outside.	5639-40744-0016	9.49	On the contrary, he resolved to tell them, that repenting of his violence, and moved by her tears, he had only carried her half way towards his house, and then let her go.
5639-40744-0010	4.12	It is the only amends I ask of you for the wrong you have done me".	5639-40744-0017	5.88	Choking with emotion, Leocadi made a sign to her parents that she wished to be alone with them.
5639-40744-0010	4.12	It is the only amends I ask of you for the wrong you have done me".	5639-40744-0020	9.82	Thus did this humane and right minded father comfort his unhappy daughter; and her mother embracing her again did all she could to soothe her feelings.
5639-40744-0011	2.665	She found the door, but it was locked outside.	5639-40744-0024	8.845	One day, when the boy was sent by his grandfather with a message to a relation, he passed along a street in which there was a great concourse of horsemen.
5639-40744-0011	2.665	She found the door, but it was locked outside.	5639-40744-0025	8.785	The bed she too well remembered was there; and, above all, the cabinet, on which had stood the image she had taken away, was still on the same spot.
5639-40744-0010	4.12	It is the only amends I ask of you for the wrong you have done me".	5639-40744-0029	7.305	This truth which I have learned from her lips is confirmed by his face, in which we have both beheld that of our son".
5639-40744-0010	4.12	It is the only amends I ask of you for the wrong you have done me".	5639-40744-0033	9.15	Her bearing was graceful and animated; she led her son by the hand, and before her walked two maids with wax lights and silver candlesticks.
260-123440-0003	3.585	Oh! won't she be savage if I've kept her waiting"!	260-123440-0010	8.315	How cheerfully he seems to grin, How neatly spread his claws, And welcome little fishes in With gently smiling jaws"!
260-123440-0003	3.585	Oh! won't she be savage if I've kept her waiting"!	260-123440-0011	4.87	No, I've made up my mind about it; if I'm Mabel, I'll stay down here!
260-123288-0019	2.955	At noon the violence of the storm redoubles.	260-123440-0012	5.245	It'll be no use their putting their heads down and saying 'Come up again, dear!
260-123286-0022	3.235	Two hours afterwards a terrible shock awoke me.	260-123440-0015	6.2	I wish I hadn't cried so much"! said Alice, as she swam about, trying to find her way out.
260-123286-0024	3.04	There's a whale, a whale"! cried the Professor.	260-123440-0016	4.895	I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears!
260-123288-0009	3.435	Those clouds seem as if they were going to crush the sea".	260-123440-0019	6.63	cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt certain it must be really offended.
260-123440-0018	3.64	I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse"!	260-123440-0020	4.995	We won't talk about her any more if you'd rather not". "We indeed"!
2300-131720-0006	4.12	There seems no good reason for believing that it will change.	2300-131720-0000	5.08	The Paris plant, like that at the Crystal Palace, was a temporary exhibit.
2300-131720-0014	3.75	mister Edison was a leader far ahead of the time.	2300-131720-0005	6.9	Why, if we erect a station at the falls, it is a great economy to get it up to the city.
2300-131720-0041	3.75	We had meters in which there were two bottles of liquid.	2300-131720-0006	4.12	There seems no good reason for believing that it will change.
2300-131720-0014	3.75	mister Edison was a leader far ahead of the time.	2300-131720-0008	9.125	Everything he has done has been aimed at the conservation of energy, the contraction of space, the intensification of culture.
2300-131720-0041	3.75	We had meters in which there were two bottles of liquid.	2300-131720-0009	9.605	For some years it was not found feasible to operate motors on alternating current circuits, and that reason was often urged against it seriously.
2300-131720-0006	4.12	There seems no good reason for believing that it will change.	2300-131720-0015	8.875	He obtained the desired speed and load with a friction brake; also regulator of speed; but waited for an indicator to verify it.
2300-131720-0041	3.75	We had meters in which there were two bottles of liquid.	2300-131720-0024	4.77	But the plant ran, and it was the first three wire station in this country".
2300-131720-0014	3.75	mister Edison was a leader far ahead of the time.	2300-131720-0027	8.62	Edison held that the electricity sold must be measured just like gas or water, and he proceeded to develop a meter.
2300-131720-0014	3.75	mister Edison was a leader far ahead of the time.	2300-131720-0029	6.425	Hence the Edison electrolytic meter is no longer used, despite its excellent qualities.
2300-131720-0006	4.12	There seems no good reason for believing that it will change.	2300-131720-0030	9.98	The principle employed in the Edison electrolytic meter is that which exemplifies the power of electricity to decompose a chemical substance.
2300-131720-0041	3.75	We had meters in which there were two bottles of liquid.	2300-131720-0034	8.605	the others having been in operation too short a time to show definite results, although they also went quickly to a dividend basis.
2300-131720-0014	3.75	mister Edison was a leader far ahead of the time.	2300-131720-0037	7.965	He weighed and reweighed the meter plates, and pursued every line of investigation imaginable, but all in vain.
2300-131720-0041	3.75	We had meters in which there were two bottles of liquid.	2300-131720-0038	5.61	He felt he was up against it, and that perhaps another kind of a job would suit him better.
2300-131720-0041	3.75	We had meters in which there were two bottles of liquid.	2300-131720-0040	5.455	We were more interested in the technical condition of the station than in the commercial part.

908-157963-0018	4.255	And fearest thou because I vanish and am seen no more.	908-31957-0003	6.565	When called before, I told how hastily I dropped my flowers or brake off from a game.
908-157963-0001	2.885	O life of this our spring!	908-31957-0005	4.49	Alas, I have grieved so I am hard to love.
908-31957-0018	3.915	But thou art not such A lover, my Beloved!	908-31957-0006	5.89	Open thy heart wide, And fold within, the wet wings of thy dove.
908-157963-0002	2.755	why fades the lotus of the water?	908-31957-0007	5.8	Could it mean To last, a love set pendulous between Sorrow and sorrow?
908-157963-0029	3.63	Why a Tongue impressed with honey from every wind?	908-31957-0009	7.705	And, though I have grown serene And strong since then, I think that God has willed A still renewable fear...
908-31957-0005	4.49	Alas, I have grieved so I am hard to love.	908-31957-0012	7.615	if he, to keep one oath, Must lose one joy, by his life's star foretold.
908-157963-0002	2.755	why fades the lotus of the water?	908-31957-0013	6.18	Slow to world greetings, quick with its "O, list," When the angels speak.
908-157963-0024	3.44	image of weakness, art thou but a Worm?	908-31957-0014	7.56	A ring of amethyst I could not wear here, plainer to my sight, Than that first kiss.
908-31957-0005	4.49	Alas, I have grieved so I am hard to love.	908-31957-0016	6.48	Dearest, teach me so To pour out gratitude, as thou dost, good!
908-31957-0018	3.915	But thou art not such A lover, my Beloved!	908-31957-0017	7.795	Mussulmans and Giaours Throw kerchiefs at a smile, and have no ruth For any weeping.
908-157963-0002	2.755	why fades the lotus of the water?	908-31957-0019	9.54	thou canst wait Through sorrow and sickness, to bring souls to touch, And think it soon when others cry "Too late".
908-157963-0013	4.315	And why it scatters its bright beauty thro the humid air.	908-31957-0020	5.895	I thank all who have loved me in their hearts, With thanks and love from mine.
908-31957-0018	3.915	But thou art not such A lover, my Beloved!	908-31957-0023	8.515	I love thee freely, as men strive for Right; I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
908-157963-0002	2.755	why fades the lotus of the water?	908-31957-0024	7.54	I love thee with the passion put to use In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
4992-41797-0016	3.3	They couldn't run nor move; they're just pasteboard".	4992-41806-0001	8.31	To night there was no need of extra heat, and there were great ceremonies to be observed in lighting the fires on the hearthstones.
4992-41797-0016	3.3	They couldn't run nor move; they're just pasteboard".	4992-41806-0003	9.24	Kathleen waved the torch to and fro as she recited some beautiful lines written for some such purpose as that which called them together to night.
4992-41797-0016	3.3	They couldn't run nor move; they're just pasteboard".	4992-41806-0009	4.355	exclaimed Bill Harmon to his wife as they went through the lighted hall.
4992-23283-0007	4.045	To ask any more questions of you, I believe, would be unfair.	4992-41806-0011	7.84	Mother Carey poured coffee, Nancy chocolate, and the others helped serve the sandwiches and cake, doughnuts and tarts.
4992-23283-0016	4.495	Again he searched his own thoughts; nor ineffectually as before.	4992-41806-0012	6.73	At that moment the gentleman entered, bearing a huge object concealed by a piece of green felt.
4992-41797-0016	3.3	They couldn't run nor move; they're just pasteboard".	4992-41806-0013	6.02	Approaching the dining table, he carefully placed the article in the centre and removed the cloth.
7021-85628-0004	2.805	Yes, why not"? thought Anders.	7021-85628-0002	6.455	He was such a big boy that he wore high boots and carried a jack knife.
7021-85628-0006	3.58	I am going to the court ball," answered Anders.	7021-85628-0005	5.015	Seeing that I am so fine, I may as well go and visit the King".
7021-85628-0025	2.775	But his mother hugged him close.	7021-85628-0008	7.125	For, like as not, they must have thought him a prince when they saw his fine cap.
7021-79759-0001	2.48	That is comparatively nothing.	7021-85628-0009	8.54	At the farther end of the largest hall a table was set with golden cups and golden plates in long rows.
7021-85628-0019	3.255	With one jump Anders got out of his chair.	7021-85628-0010	8.015	On huge silver platters were pyramids of tarts and cakes, and red wine sparkled in glittering decanters.
7021-79740-0012	3.26	said she, pointing to the playthings; "see!	7021-85628-0011	8.995	The Princess sat down under a blue canopy with bouquets of roses; and she let Anders sit in a golden chair by her side.
7021-79740-0009	3.635	They were now playing with their dolls in the parlor.	7021-85628-0012	5.33	But you must not eat with your cap on your head," she said, and was going to take it off.
7021-85628-0026	2.74	No, my little son," she said.	7021-85628-0016	4.28	That is a very fine cap you have," he said.
7021-79740-0012	3.26	said she, pointing to the playthings; "see!	7021-85628-0018	8.22	And it is made of mother's best yarn, and she knitted it herself, and everybody wants to get it away from me".
7021-79740-0012	3.26	said she, pointing to the playthings; "see!	7021-85628-0020	6.45	He darted like an arrow through all the halls, down all the stairs, and across the yard.
7021-79740-0009	3.635	They were now playing with their dolls in the parlor.	7021-85628-0021	5.365	He still held on to it with both hands as he rushed into his mother's cottage.
7021-79740-0009	3.635	They were now playing with their dolls in the parlor.	7021-85628-0022	5.145	And all his brothers and sisters stood round and listened with their mouths open.
7021-79740-0009	3.635	They were now playing with their dolls in the parlor.	7021-85628-0023	9.03	But when his big brother heard that he had refused to give his cap for a King's golden crown, he said that Anders was a stupid.
7021-85628-0019	3.255	With one jump Anders got out of his chair.	7021-85628-0027	8.5	If you dressed in silk and gold from top to toe, you could not look any nicer than in your little red cap".
1284-1181-0007	4.04	She poured into the dish a quantity from each of these bottles.	1284-134647-0000	8.53	The grateful applause of the clergy has consecrated the memory of a prince who indulged their passions and promoted their interest.
4970-29095-0011	3.355	Does thee think thee could stand it six months?	4970-29095-0002	5.48	Well, mother," said the young student, looking up, with a shade of impatience.
4970-29095-0006	4.47	Is thy father willing thee should go away to a school of the world's people"?	4970-29095-0004	9.61	I heard father tell cousin Abner that he was whipped so often for whistling when he was a boy that he was determined to have what compensation he could get now".
4970-29095-0014	3.26	Where thee and thy family are known"?	4970-29095-0005	4.65	Thy ways greatly try me, Ruth, and all thy relations.
4970-29093-0015	3.325	You can begin by carrying a rod, and putting down the figures.	4970-29095-0006	4.47	Is thy father willing thee should go away to a school of the world's people"?
4970-29095-0014	3.26	Where thee and thy family are known"?	4970-29095-0009	5.6	Margaret Bolton almost lost for a moment her habitual placidity.
4970-29095-0000	2.865	She was tired of other things.	4970-29095-0012	4.68	And, besides, suppose thee does learn medicine"?
4970-29095-0014	3.26	Where thee and thy family are known"?	4970-29095-0016	6.945	Ruth sat quite still for a time, with face intent and flushed. It was out now.
4970-29095-0011	3.355	Does thee think thee could stand it six months?	4970-29095-0022	4.765	Is thee going to the Yearly Meeting, Ruth"? asked one of the girls.
4970-29093-0000	3.03	You'll never dig it out of the Astor Library".	4970-29095-0024	6.04	It has occupied mother a long time, to find at the shops the exact shade for her new bonnet.
4970-29093-0017	2.865	I've been ready to go anywhere for six months.	4970-29095-0027	9.795	It's such a crush at the Yearly Meeting at Arch Street, and then there's the row of sleek looking young men who line the curbstone and stare at us as we come out.
4970-29093-0008	3.58	He wanted to begin at the top of the ladder.	4970-29095-0030	4.67	Father, thee's unjust to Philip. He's going into business".
4970-29095-0017	3.93	The sight seers returned in high spirits from the city.	4970-29095-0032	6.61	But Philip is honest, and he has talent enough, if he will stop scribbling, to make his way.
4970-29093-0008	3.58	He wanted to begin at the top of the ladder.	4970-29095-0034	5.81	Why should I rust, and be stupid, and sit in inaction because I am a girl?
4970-29095-0011	3.355	Does thee think thee could stand it six months?	4970-29095-0035	4.75	And if I had a fortune, would thee want me to lead a useless life"?
4970-29093-0017	2.865	I've been ready to go anywhere for six months.	4970-29095-0036	5.25	Has thee consulted thy mother about a career, I suppose it is a career thee wants"?
4970-29093-0000	3.03	You'll never dig it out of the Astor Library".	4970-29095-0037	6.885	But that wise and placid woman understood the sweet rebel a great deal better than Ruth understood herself.
4970-29093-0000	3.03	You'll never dig it out of the Astor Library".	4970-29095-0038	8.74	Ruth was glad to hear that Philip had made a push into the world, and she was sure that his talent and courage would make a way for him.
121-127105-0032	3.17	Yes, but that's just the beauty of her passion".	121-127105-0000	9.875	It was this observation that drew from Douglas not immediately, but later in the evening a reply that had the interesting consequence to which I call attention.
121-127105-0018	2.77	cried the ladies whose departure had been fixed.	121-127105-0001	5.025	Someone else told a story not particularly effective, which I saw he was not following.
121-127105-0032	3.17	Yes, but that's just the beauty of her passion".	121-127105-0002	7.495	cried one of the women. He took no notice of her; he looked at me, but as if, instead of me, he saw what he spoke of.
121-127105-0036	4.15	But was that all her reward"? one of the ladies asked.	121-127105-0003	7.725	There was a unanimous groan at this, and much reproach; after which, in his preoccupied way, he explained.
121-127105-0032	3.17	Yes, but that's just the beauty of her passion".	121-127105-0005	5.82	I could write to my man and enclose the key; he could send down the packet as he finds it".
121-127105-0018	2.77	cried the ladies whose departure had been fixed.	121-127105-0006	4.725	The others resented postponement, but it was just his scruples that charmed me.
121-127105-0036	4.15	But was that all her reward"? one of the ladies asked.	121-127105-0007	5.79	To this his answer was prompt. "Oh, thank God, no"! "And is the record yours?
121-127105-0010	2.85	She sent me the pages in question before she died".	121-127105-0011	5.78	She was the most agreeable woman I've ever known in her position; she would have been worthy of any whatever.
121-127105-0010	2.85	She sent me the pages in question before she died".	121-127105-0012	4.83	It wasn't simply that she said so, but that I knew she hadn't. I was sure; I could see.
121-127105-0010	2.85	She sent me the pages in question before she died".	121-127105-0013	5.895	You'll easily judge why when you hear". "Because the thing had been such a scare"? He continued to fix me.
121-127105-0036	4.15	But was that all her reward"? one of the ladies asked.	121-127105-0022	5.075	Well, if I don't know who she was in love with, I know who he was".
121-127105-0018	2.77	cried the ladies whose departure had been fixed.	121-127105-0026	7.53	The first of these touches conveyed that the written statement took up the tale at a point after it had, in a manner, begun.
121-127105-0018	2.77	cried the ladies whose departure had been fixed.	121-127105-0028	6.75	The awkward thing was that they had practically no other relations and that his own affairs took up all his time.
121-127105-0015	2.96	He quitted the fire and dropped back into his chair.	121-127105-0029	7.31	There were plenty of people to help, but of course the young lady who should go down as governess would be in supreme authority.
121-127105-0036	4.15	But was that all her reward"? one of the ladies asked.	121-127105-0034	7.41	It sounded dull it sounded strange; and all the more so because of his main condition". "Which was-"?
121-127105-0008	2.76	He hung fire again. "A woman's.	121-127105-0036	4.15	But was that all her reward"? one of the ladies asked.
260-123288-0012	3.545	That will be safest". "No, no! Never"!	260-123286-0000	7.04	Saturday, august fifteenth. - The sea unbroken all round. No land in sight.
260-123286-0012	2.43	But there seemed no reason to fear.	260-123286-0002	9.985	All my danger and sufferings were needed to strike a spark of human feeling out of him; but now that I am well his nature has resumed its sway.
260-123440-0005	3.105	And yesterday things went on just as usual.	260-123286-0003	7.37	You seem anxious, my uncle," I said, seeing him continually with his glass to his eye. "Anxious!
260-123286-0024	3.04	There's a whale, a whale"! cried the Professor.	260-123286-0005	4.81	I am not complaining that the rate is slow, but that the sea is so wide".
260-123288-0019	2.955	At noon the violence of the storm redoubles.	260-123286-0006	7.405	We are losing time, and the fact is, I have not come all this way to take a little sail upon a pond on a raft".
260-123288-0019	2.955	At noon the violence of the storm redoubles.	260-123286-0007	4.55	He called this sea a pond, and our long voyage, taking a little sail!
260-123286-0022	3.235	Two hours afterwards a terrible shock awoke me.	260-123286-0009	5.795	I take this as my answer, and I leave the Professor to bite his lips with impatience.
260-123286-0001	3.07	The horizon seems extremely distant.	260-123286-0011	4.255	Nothing new. Weather unchanged. The wind freshens.
260-123286-0024	3.04	There's a whale, a whale"! cried the Professor.	260-123286-0013	4.73	The shadow of the raft was clearly outlined upon the surface of the waves.
260-123440-0018	3.64	I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse"!	260-123286-0015	5.21	It must be as wide as the Mediterranean or the Atlantic - and why not?
260-123288-0019	2.955	At noon the violence of the storm redoubles.	260-123286-0016	7	These thoughts agitated me all day, and my imagination scarcely calmed down after several hours' sleep.
260-123440-0006	2.715	I wonder if I've been changed in the night?	260-123286-0018	5.67	I saw at the Hamburg museum the skeleton of one of these creatures thirty feet in length.
260-123288-0009	3.435	Those clouds seem as if they were going to crush the sea".	260-123286-0023	5.875	The raft was heaved up on a watery mountain and pitched down again, at a distance of twenty fathoms.
260-123286-0024	3.04	There's a whale, a whale"! cried the Professor.	260-123286-0025	9.205	Flight was out of the question now. The reptiles rose; they wheeled around our little raft with a rapidity greater than that of express trains.
260-123288-0020	2.9	Each of us is lashed to some part of the raft.	260-123286-0026	6.94	Two monsters only were creating all this commotion; and before my eyes are two reptiles of the primitive world.
260-123286-0022	3.235	Two hours afterwards a terrible shock awoke me.	260-123286-0027	7.17	I can distinguish the eye of the ichthyosaurus glowing like a red hot coal, and as large as a man's head.
260-123286-0024	3.04	There's a whale, a whale"! cried the Professor.	260-123286-0029	4.545	Those huge creatures attacked each other with the greatest animosity.
260-123440-0005	3.105	And yesterday things went on just as usual.	260-123286-0030	7.53	Suddenly the ichthyosaurus and the plesiosaurus disappear below, leaving a whirlpool eddying in the water.
260-123288-0022	3.705	They seem to be 'We are lost'; but I am not sure.	260-123286-0031	5.06	As for the ichthyosaurus - has he returned to his submarine cavern?
3575-170457-0031	4	On august twenty seventh, eighteen thirty seven, she writes:	3575-170457-0000	8.23	And often has my mother said, While on her lap I laid my head, She feared for time I was not made, But for Eternity.
3575-170457-0032	3.03	Come, come. I am getting really tired of your absence.	3575-170457-0003	7.595	Surely, it must be because we are in danger of loving each other too well - of losing sight of the Creator in idolatry of the creature.
3575-170457-0049	2.715	This decision was communicated to the girls.	3575-170457-0005	7.34	She, a Tory and clergyman's daughter, was always in a minority of one in our house of violent Dissent and Radicalism.
3575-170457-0052	3	She had another weight on her mind this Christmas.	3575-170457-0006	8.3	Her feeble health gave her her yielding manner, for she could never oppose any one without gathering up all her strength for the struggle.
3575-170457-0031	4	On august twenty seventh, eighteen thirty seven, she writes:	3575-170457-0007	7.775	He spoke French perfectly, I have been told, when need was; but delighted usually in talking the broadest Yorkshire.
3575-170457-0031	4	On august twenty seventh, eighteen thirty seven, she writes:	3575-170457-0010	4.79	I am not depreciating it when I say that in these times it is not rare.
3575-170457-0049	2.715	This decision was communicated to the girls.	3575-170457-0011	7.015	But it is not with a view to distinction that you should cultivate this talent, if you consult your own happiness.
3575-170457-0049	2.715	This decision was communicated to the girls.	3575-170457-0012	5.850062	You will say that a woman has no need of such a caution; there can be no peril in it for her.
3575-170457-0031	4	On august twenty seventh, eighteen thirty seven, she writes:	3575-170457-0013	9.175	The more she is engaged in her proper duties, the less leisure will she have for it, even as an accomplishment and a recreation.
3575-170457-0031	4	On august twenty seventh, eighteen thirty seven, she writes:	3575-170457-0014	6.68	To those duties you have not yet been called, and when you are you will be less eager for celebrity.
3575-170457-0004	3.105	We used to dispute about politics and religion.	3575-170457-0019	6.155	I had not ventured to hope for such a reply; so considerate in its tone, so noble in its spirit.
3575-170457-0056	3.370062	I doubt whether Branwell was maintaining himself at this time.	3575-170457-0020	8.645	I know the first letter I wrote to you was all senseless trash from beginning to end; but I am not altogether the idle dreaming being it would seem to denote.
3575-170457-0032	3.03	Come, come. I am getting really tired of your absence.	3575-170457-0021	4.18	I thought it therefore my duty, when I left school, to become a governess.
3575-170457-0004	3.105	We used to dispute about politics and religion.	3575-170457-0022	5.825	In the evenings, I confess, I do think, but I never trouble any one else with my thoughts.
3575-170457-0049	2.715	This decision was communicated to the girls.	3575-170457-0023	9.095	I carefully avoid any appearance of preoccupation and eccentricity, which might lead those I live amongst to suspect the nature of my pursuits.
3575-170457-0034	3.495	in this monotonous life of mine, that was a pleasant event.	3575-170457-0025	9.205	Again I thank you. This incident, I suppose, will be renewed no more; if I live to be an old woman, I shall remember it thirty years hence as a bright dream.
3575-170457-0031	4	On august twenty seventh, eighteen thirty seven, she writes:	3575-170457-0027	4.58	I cannot deny myself the gratification of inserting Southey's reply:
3575-170457-0049	2.715	This decision was communicated to the girls.	3575-170457-0029	6.055	Your letter has given me great pleasure, and I should not forgive myself if I did not tell you so.
3575-170457-0049	2.715	This decision was communicated to the girls.	3575-170457-0030	8.945063	Of this second letter, also, she spoke, and told me that it contained an invitation for her to go and see the poet if ever she visited the Lakes.
3575-170457-0021	4.18	I thought it therefore my duty, when I left school, to become a governess.	3575-170457-0033	8.5	Saturday after Saturday comes round, and I can have no hope of hearing your knock at the door, and then being told that 'Miss E. is come'. Oh, dear!
3575-170457-0049	2.715	This decision was communicated to the girls.	3575-170457-0035	9.37	I wish it would recur again; but it will take two or three interviews before the stiffness - the estrangement of this long separation - will wear away".
3575-170457-0034	3.495	in this monotonous life of mine, that was a pleasant event.	3575-170457-0040	6.905	Indeed, there were only one or two strangers who could be admitted among the sisters without producing the same result.
3575-170457-0049	2.715	This decision was communicated to the girls.	3575-170457-0044	9.72	After this disappointment, I never dare reckon with certainty on the enjoyment of a pleasure again; it seems as if some fatality stood between you and me.
3575-170457-0001	2.99	Why are we to be denied each other's society?	3575-170457-0045	6.52	I am not good enough for you, and you must be kept from the contamination of too intimate society.
3575-170457-0049	2.715	This decision was communicated to the girls.	3575-170457-0047	6.525	Tabby had lived with them for ten or twelve years, and was, as Charlotte expressed it, "one of the family".
3575-170457-0052	3	She had another weight on her mind this Christmas.	3575-170457-0048	5.555	He refused at first to listen to the careful advice; it was repugnant to his liberal nature.
3575-170457-0049	2.715	This decision was communicated to the girls.	3575-170457-0050	6.405	Tabby had tended them in their childhood; they, and none other, should tend her in her infirmity and age.
3575-170457-0056	3.370062	I doubt whether Branwell was maintaining himself at this time.	3575-170457-0051	4.915	At tea time, they were sad and silent, and the meal went away untouched by any of the three.
3575-170457-0031	4	On august twenty seventh, eighteen thirty seven, she writes:	3575-170457-0054	8.005	Stung by anxiety for this little sister, she upbraided Miss W -- for her fancied indifference to Anne's state of health.
4970-29093-0008	3.58	He wanted to begin at the top of the ladder.	4970-29093-0007	6.995	It is such a noble ambition, that it is a pity it has usually such a shallow foundation.
4970-29095-0011	3.355	Does thee think thee could stand it six months?	4970-29093-0009	9.12	Philip therefore read diligently in the Astor library, planned literary works that should compel attention, and nursed his genius.
4970-29093-0017	2.865	I've been ready to go anywhere for six months.	4970-29093-0012	8.71	But Philip did afford it, and he wrote, thanking his friends, and declining because he said the political scheme would fail, and ought to fail.
4970-29093-0017	2.865	I've been ready to go anywhere for six months.	4970-29093-0013	8.01	And he went back to his books and to his waiting for an opening large enough for his dignified entrance into the literary world.
4970-29095-0008	3.04	Mother, I'm going to study medicine"?	4970-29093-0014	4.275	Well, I'm going as an engineer. You can go as one".
4970-29093-0017	2.865	I've been ready to go anywhere for six months.	4970-29093-0018	9.715	The two young men who were by this time full of the adventure, went down to the Wall street office of Henry's uncle and had a talk with that wily operator.
4970-29093-0015	3.325	You can begin by carrying a rod, and putting down the figures.	4970-29093-0019	7.47	The night was spent in packing up and writing letters, for Philip would not take such an important step without informing his friends.
4970-29093-0004	3.75	He was unable to decide exactly what it should be.	4970-29093-0020	5.58	Why, it's in Missouri somewhere, on the frontier I think. We'll get a map".
4970-29093-0017	2.865	I've been ready to go anywhere for six months.	4970-29093-0022	6.22	He knew his uncle would be glad to hear that he had at last turned his thoughts to a practical matter.
4970-29095-0011	3.355	Does thee think thee could stand it six months?	4970-29093-0023	8.07	He well knew the perils of the frontier, the savage state of society, the lurking Indians and the dangers of fever.
1284-1181-0019	3.2	I now use them as ornamental statuary in my garden.	1284-1180-0000	8.12	He wore blue silk stockings, blue knee pants with gold buckles, a blue ruffled waist and a jacket of bright blue braided with gold.
1284-1181-0007	4.04	She poured into the dish a quantity from each of these bottles.	1284-1180-0001	7.755	His hat had a peaked crown and a flat brim, and around the brim was a row of tiny golden bells that tinkled when he moved.
1284-1181-0021	2.7	asked the voice, in scornful accents.	1284-1180-0002	7.68	Instead of shoes, the old man wore boots with turnover tops and his blue coat had wide cuffs of gold braid.
1284-1180-0004	4.285	When they were outside, Unc simply latched the door and started up the path.	1284-1180-0003	4.835	For a long time he had wished to explore the beautiful Land of Oz in which they lived.
1284-1180-0014	3.665	Ojo had never eaten such a fine meal in all his life.	1284-1180-0004	4.285	When they were outside, Unc simply latched the door and started up the path.
1284-1181-0002	3.835	The head of the Patchwork Girl was the most curious part of her.	1284-1180-0005	6.55	No one would disturb their little house, even if anyone came so far into the thick forest while they were gone.
1284-1180-0004	4.285	When they were outside, Unc simply latched the door and started up the path.	1284-1180-0006	6.865	At the foot of the mountain that separated the Country of the Munchkins from the Country of the Gillikins, the path divided.
1284-1180-0004	4.285	When they were outside, Unc simply latched the door and started up the path.	1284-1180-0007	6.265	He knew it would take them to the house of the Crooked Magician, whom he had never seen but who was their nearest neighbor.
1284-1180-0014	3.665	Ojo had never eaten such a fine meal in all his life.	1284-1180-0009	6.285	Then they started on again and two hours later came in sight of the house of doctor Pipt.
1284-1181-0002	3.835	The head of the Patchwork Girl was the most curious part of her.	1284-1180-0010	8.635	Unc knocked at the door of the house and a chubby, pleasant faced woman, dressed all in blue, opened it and greeted the visitors with a smile.
1284-1180-0014	3.665	Ojo had never eaten such a fine meal in all his life.	1284-1180-0011	4.275	I am, my dear, and all strangers are welcome to my home".
1284-1180-0011	4.275	I am, my dear, and all strangers are welcome to my home".	1284-1180-0012	4.88	We have come from a far lonelier place than this". "A lonelier place!
1284-1180-0022	2.885	I'm afraid I don't know much about the Land of Oz.	1284-1180-0015	5.835	We are traveling," replied Ojo, "and we stopped at your house just to rest and refresh ourselves.

1284-1181-0002	3.835	The head of the Patchwork Girl was the most curious part of her.	1284-1180-0021	9.84	I think the next Glass Cat the Magician makes will have neither brains nor heart, for then it will not object to catching mice and may prove of some use to us".
1284-1180-0022	2.885	I'm afraid I don't know much about the Land of Oz.	1284-1180-0023	5.61	You see, I've lived all my life with Unc Nunkie, the Silent One, and there was no one to tell me anything".
1284-1181-0007	4.04	She poured into the dish a quantity from each of these bottles.	1284-1180-0024	5.26	That is one reason you are Ojo the Unlucky," said the woman, in a sympathetic tone.
1284-1181-0007	4.04	She poured into the dish a quantity from each of these bottles.	1284-1180-0025	8.705	I think I must show you my Patchwork Girl," said Margolotte, laughing at the boy's astonishment, "for she is rather difficult to explain.
1284-1180-0004	4.285	When they were outside, Unc simply latched the door and started up the path.	1284-1180-0026	8.29	But first I will tell you that for many years I have longed for a servant to help me with the housework and to cook the meals and wash the dishes.
1284-1181-0007	4.04	She poured into the dish a quantity from each of these bottles.	1284-1180-0028	6.045	A bed quilt made of patches of different kinds and colors of cloth, all neatly sewed together.
1284-1181-0002	3.835	The head of the Patchwork Girl was the most curious part of her.	1284-1180-0029	5.335	Sometimes it is called a 'crazy quilt,' because the patches and colors are so mixed up.
1284-1180-0004	4.285	When they were outside, Unc simply latched the door and started up the path.	1284-1180-0031	4.825	At the Emerald City, where our Princess Ozma lives, green is the popular color.
1284-1181-0002	3.835	The head of the Patchwork Girl was the most curious part of her.	1284-1180-0032	5.78	I will show you what a good job I did," and she went to a tall cupboard and threw open the doors.

3570-5694-0012	3.205	There is a more or less elaborate system of rank and grades.	3570-5694-0013	5.61	This differentiation is furthered by the inheritance of wealth and the consequent inheritance of gentility.

8463-294828-0021	2.735	A route slightly less direct, that's all.	8463-294828-0003	9.34	I wanted nothing more than to see my country again, my friends, my modest quarters by the Botanical Gardens, my dearly beloved collections!
8463-294828-0026	2.745	We have a commander who's game for anything"!	8463-294828-0006	7.32	From rubbing shoulders with scientists in our little universe by the Botanical Gardens, the boy had come to know a thing or two.
8463-294828-0026	2.745	We have a commander who's game for anything"!	8463-294828-0009	4.17	Not once did he comment on the length or the hardships of a journey.
8463-287645-0009	3.71	I never knew of but one man who could ever please him.	8463-294828-0010	8.34	Never did he object to buckling up his suitcase for any country whatever, China or the Congo, no matter how far off it was.
8463-294828-0011	3.91	He went here, there, and everywhere in perfect contentment.	8463-294828-0012	4.905	Please forgive me for this underhanded way of admitting I had turned forty.
8463-287645-0008	3.325	As usual nothing was done in the way of punishment".	8463-294828-0013	7.2	He was a fanatic on formality, and he only addressed me in the third person to the point where it got tiresome.
8463-287645-0009	3.71	I never knew of but one man who could ever please him.	8463-294828-0014	5.725	There was good reason to stop and think, even for the world's most emotionless man.
8463-294828-0005	2.44	Conseil was my manservant.	8463-294828-0015	4.88	Conseil"! I called a third time. Conseil appeared.

8463-294825-0008	3.98	But much of the novel's brooding power comes from Captain Nemo.	8463-294828-0019	4.53	Anyhow, we'll leave instructions to ship the whole menagerie to France".
8463-287645-0001	3.545	It is hardly necessary to say more of them here.	8463-294828-0020	5.915	Yes, we are... certainly...," I replied evasively, "but after we make a detour".
8463-287645-0008	3.325	As usual nothing was done in the way of punishment".	8463-294828-0023	4.745	You see, my friend, it's an issue of the monster, the notorious narwhale.
8463-294828-0026	2.745	We have a commander who's game for anything"!	8463-294828-0027	5.98	I left instructions for shipping my containers of stuffed animals and dried plants to Paris, France.
8463-294828-0034	3.505	We'll be quite comfortable here," I told Conseil.	8463-294828-0028	7.915	I opened a line of credit sufficient to cover the babirusa and, Conseil at my heels, I jumped into a carriage.
8463-294828-0011	3.91	He went here, there, and everywhere in perfect contentment.	8463-294828-0029	5.285	Our baggage was immediately carried to the deck of the frigate. I rushed aboard.

8463-294825-0008	3.98	But much of the novel's brooding power comes from Captain Nemo.	8463-294828-0033	6.365	I was well satisfied with my cabin, which was located in the stern and opened into the officers' mess.
8463-294828-0009	4.17	Not once did he comment on the length or the hardships of a journey.	8463-294828-0036	6.985	The wharves of Brooklyn, and every part of New York bordering the East River, were crowded with curiosity seekers.
7127-75947-0008	4.155	The arrow pierced his heart and wounded him mortally.	7127-75947-0001	6.64	Upon this Madame deigned to turn her eyes languishingly towards the comte, observing.
7127-75947-0002	3.235	Do you think so"? she replied with indifference.	7127-75947-0003	5.98	Yes; the character which your royal highness assumed is in perfect harmony with your own".
7127-75946-0025	3.96	The ballet began; the effect was more than beautiful.	7127-75947-0007	5.46	She then rose, humming the air to which she was presently going to dance.
7127-75946-0005	2.67	What do you mean"? inquired Louis,	7127-75947-0008	4.155	The arrow pierced his heart and wounded him mortally.
7127-75947-0002	3.235	Do you think so"? she replied with indifference.	7127-75947-0010	8.865	When she perceived the young man, she rose, like a woman surprised in the midst of ideas she was desirous of concealing from herself.
7127-75946-0005	2.67	What do you mean"? inquired Louis,	7127-75947-0013	5.045	I remember now, and I congratulate myself. Do you love any one"?
7127-75947-0018	4.04	I have been here this quarter of an hour," replied La Valliere.	7127-75947-0015	6.26	There cannot be a doubt he received you kindly, for, in fact, you returned without his permission".
7127-75946-0010	3.6	Your majesty's plan, then, in this affair, is	7127-75947-0016	7.48	Oh! mademoiselle, why have I not a devoted sister, or a true friend, such as yourself"?
7127-75947-0018	4.04	I have been here this quarter of an hour," replied La Valliere.	7127-75947-0024	7.33	Look yonder, do you not see the moon slowly rising, silvering the topmost branches of the chestnuts and the oaks.
7127-75947-0018	4.04	I have been here this quarter of an hour," replied La Valliere.	7127-75947-0025	5.57	exquisite soft turf of the woods, the happiness which your friendship confers upon me!
7127-75946-0025	3.96	The ballet began; the effect was more than beautiful.	7127-75947-0028	7.46	Quick, quick, then, among the high reed grass," said Montalais; "stoop, Athenais, you are so tall".
7127-75946-0025	3.96	The ballet began; the effect was more than beautiful.	7127-75947-0029	5.285	The young girls had, indeed, made themselves small - indeed invisible.
7127-75947-0019	3.875	Did not the dancing amuse you"? "No".	7127-75947-0032	4.745	Yes; but perhaps I frightened her". "In what way"?
7127-75947-0018	4.04	I have been here this quarter of an hour," replied La Valliere.	7127-75947-0035	4.415	Good gracious! has the king any right to interfere in matters of that kind?
7127-75947-0018	4.04	I have been here this quarter of an hour," replied La Valliere.	7127-75947-0037	8.824938	Oh! I am speaking seriously," replied Montalais, "and my opinion in this case is quite as good as the king's, I suppose; is it not, Louise"?

908-157963-0009	4.06	Why should the mistress of the vales of Har, utter a sigh.	908-157963-0006	8.11	And gentle sleep the sleep of death, and gently hear the voice Of him that walketh in the garden in the evening time.
908-157963-0029	3.63	Why a Tongue impressed with honey from every wind?	908-157963-0009	4.06	Why should the mistress of the vales of Har, utter a sigh.
908-31957-0018	3.915	But thou art not such A lover, my Beloved!	908-157963-0010	6.28	She ceasd and smiled in tears, then sat down in her silver shrine.
908-157963-0018	4.255	And fearest thou because I vanish and am seen no more.	908-157963-0013	4.315	And why it scatters its bright beauty thro the humid air.

908-157963-0002	2.755	why fades the lotus of the water?	908-157963-0023	9.625	The helpless worm arose and sat upon the Lillys leaf, And the bright Cloud saild on, to find his partner in the vale.
908-157963-0024	3.44	image of weakness, art thou but a Worm?	908-157963-0025	9.265	I see they lay helpless and naked: weeping And none to answer, none to cherish thee with mothers smiles.
908-157963-0029	3.63	Why a Tongue impressed with honey from every wind?	908-157963-0026	8.1	And says; Thou mother of my children, I have loved thee And I have given thee a crown that none can take away.
908-157963-0024	3.44	image of weakness, art thou but a Worm?	908-157963-0027	5.225	And lay me down in thy cold bed, and leave my shining lot.

4446-2271-0003	3.7	It's been on only two weeks, and I've been half a dozen times already.	4446-2271-0001	6.35	He had preconceived ideas about everything, and his idea about Americans was that they should be engineers or mechanics.
4446-2275-0005	4.445	I felt it in my bones when I woke this morning that something splendid was going to turn up.	4446-2271-0008	5.495	Irene Burgoyne, one of her family, told me in confidence that there was a romance somewhere back in the beginning.
4446-2271-0005	3.395	She saves her hand, too. She's at her best in the second act.	4446-2271-0009	7.82	Mainhall vouched for her constancy with a loftiness that made Alexander smile, even while a kind of rapid excitement was tingling through him.
4446-2273-0009	4.015	It's not particularly rare," she said, "but some of it was my mother's.	4446-2271-0013	4.4	Do you know, I thought the dance a bit conscious to night, for the first time.
4446-2273-0002	3.295	Lamb wouldn't care a great deal about many of them, I fancy".	4446-2271-0014	5.34	Westmere and I were back after the first act, and we thought she seemed quite uncertain of herself.
4446-2273-0033	3.3	For a long time neither Hilda nor Bartley spoke.	4446-2271-0018	5.715	She considered a moment and then said "No, I think not, though I am glad you ask me.
4446-2275-0045	2.635	We've tortured each other enough for tonight.	4446-2271-0020	7.55	Of course," he reflected, "she always had that combination of something homely and sensible, and something utterly wild and daft.
4446-2271-0005	3.395	She saves her hand, too. She's at her best in the second act.	4446-2273-0000	8.995	Hilda was very nice to him, and he sat on the edge of his chair, flushed with his conversational efforts and moving his chin about nervously over his high collar.
4446-2273-0002	3.295	Lamb wouldn't care a great deal about many of them, I fancy".	4446-2273-0001	4.66	They asked him to come to see them in Chelsea, and they spoke very tenderly of Hilda.
4446-2273-0002	3.295	Lamb wouldn't care a great deal about many of them, I fancy".	4446-2273-0003	7.835	When Bartley arrived at Bedford Square on Sunday evening, Marie, the pretty little French girl, met him at the door and conducted him upstairs.
4446-2275-0022	3.28	But why didn't you tell me when you were here in the summer"?	4446-2273-0004	5.435	I should never have asked you if Molly had been here, for I remember you don't like English cookery".
4446-2273-0034	3.59	He felt a tremor run through the slender yellow figure in front of him.	4446-2273-0005	4.125	I haven't had a chance yet to tell you what a jolly little place I think this is.
4446-2273-0002	3.295	Lamb wouldn't care a great deal about many of them, I fancy".	4446-2273-0008	7.715	I've managed to save something every year, and that with helping my three sisters now and then, and tiding poor Cousin Mike over bad seasons.
4446-2271-0013	4.4	Do you know, I thought the dance a bit conscious to night, for the first time.	4446-2273-0009	4.015	It's not particularly rare," she said, "but some of it was my mother's.
4446-2271-0000	3.495	Mainhall liked Alexander because he was an engineer.	4446-2273-0015	4.505	Don't I, though! I'm so sorry to hear it. How did her son turn out?
4446-2271-0005	3.395	She saves her hand, too. She's at her best in the second act.	4446-2273-0016	9.645	Her hair is still like flax, and her blue eyes are just like a baby's, and she has the same three freckles on her little nose, and talks about going back to her bains de mer".
4446-2275-0015	2.98	He pulled up a window as if the air were heavy.	4446-2273-0021	5.255	What she wanted from us was neither our flowers nor our francs, but just our youth.
4446-2271-0013	4.4	Do you know, I thought the dance a bit conscious to night, for the first time.	4446-2273-0022	5.865	They were both remembering what the woman had said when she took the money: "God give you a happy love"!
4446-2273-0012	2.98	Thank you. But I don't like it so well as this".	4446-2273-0023	6.1	The strange woman, and her passionate sentence that rang out so sharply, had frightened them both.
4446-2271-0024	3.16	I shouldn't wonder if she could laugh about it with me now.	4446-2273-0024	4.825	Bartley started when Hilda rang the little bell beside her. "Dear me, why did you do that?
4446-2271-0011	3.945	Sir Harry Towne, mister Bartley Alexander, the American engineer".	4446-2273-0025	4.83	It was very jolly," he murmured lazily, as Marie came in to take away the coffee.
4446-2271-0013	4.4	Do you know, I thought the dance a bit conscious to night, for the first time.	4446-2273-0028	5.405	Nonsense. Of course I can't really sing, except the way my mother and grandmother did before me.
4446-2273-0011	2.79	There is nothing else that looks so jolly".	4446-2273-0032	7.835	He stood a little behind her, and tried to steady himself as he said: "It's soft and misty. See how white the stars are".
4446-2271-0012	3.78	I say, Sir Harry, the little girl's going famously to night, isn't she"?	4446-2273-0035	6.15	Bartley leaned over her shoulder, without touching her, and whispered in her ear: "You are giving me a chance"? "Yes.
1188-133604-0013	3.02	It must, remember, be one or the other.	1188-133604-0001	9.04	They unite every quality; and sometimes you will find me referring to them as colorists, sometimes as chiaroscurists.
1188-133604-0031	4.25	There's one, and there's another - the "Dudley" and the "Flint".	1188-133604-0005	8.56	It is the head of a parrot with a little flower in his beak from a picture of Carpaccio's, one of his series of the Life of Saint George.
1188-133604-0031	4.25	There's one, and there's another - the "Dudley" and the "Flint".	1188-133604-0010	6.095	But in this vignette, copied from Turner, you have the two principles brought out perfectly.
1188-133604-0040	3.23	The crampness and the poverty are all intended.	1188-133604-0014	4.39	Do not, therefore, think that the Gothic school is an easy one.
1188-133604-0031	4.25	There's one, and there's another - the "Dudley" and the "Flint".	1188-133604-0017	4.615	That a style is restrained or severe does not mean that it is also erroneous.
1188-133604-0014	4.39	Do not, therefore, think that the Gothic school is an easy one.	1188-133604-0022	9.63	You must look at him in the face - fight him - conquer him with what scathe you may: you need not think to keep out of the way of him.
1188-133604-0031	4.25	There's one, and there's another - the "Dudley" and the "Flint".	1188-133604-0025	7.45	You know I have just been telling you how this school of materialism and clay involved itself at last in cloud and fire.
1188-133604-0040	3.23	The crampness and the poverty are all intended.	1188-133604-0031	4.25	There's one, and there's another - the "Dudley" and the "Flint".
1188-133604-0006	2.4	Then he comes to the beak of it.	1188-133604-0033	6.625	Every plant in the grass is set formally, grows perfectly, and may be realized completely.
1188-133604-0014	4.39	Do not, therefore, think that the Gothic school is an easy one.	1188-133604-0036	7.97	In both these high mythical subjects the surrounding nature, though suffering, is still dignified and beautiful.
1188-133604-0031	4.25	There's one, and there's another - the "Dudley" and the "Flint".	1188-133604-0038	5.365	But now here is a subject of which you will wonder at first why Turner drew it at all.
1188-133604-0031	4.25	There's one, and there's another - the "Dudley" and the "Flint".	1188-133604-0039	6.625	It has no beauty whatsoever, no specialty of picturesqueness; and all its lines are cramped and poor.
1188-133604-0031	4.25	There's one, and there's another - the "Dudley" and the "Flint".	1188-133604-0043	4.885	See that your lives be in nothing worse than a boy's climbing for his entangled kite.
7729-102255-0000	3.285	The bogus Legislature numbered thirty six members.	7729-102255-0002	8.3	That summer's emigration, however, being mainly from the free States, greatly changed the relative strength of the two parties.
7729-102255-0034	2.71	To their sorrow they were soon undeceived.	7729-102255-0005	5.18	This was a formidable array of advantages; slavery was playing with loaded dice.
7729-102255-0013	2.675	It was, in fact, the best weapon of its day.	7729-102255-0010	8.54	Of the lynchings, the mobs, and the murders, it would be impossible, except in a very extended work, to note the frequent and atrocious details.
7729-102255-0034	2.71	To their sorrow they were soon undeceived.	7729-102255-0012	4.075	Several hundred free State men promptly responded to the summons.
7729-102255-0034	2.71	To their sorrow they were soon undeceived.	7729-102255-0014	5.295	The leaders of the conspiracy became distrustful of their power to crush the town.
7729-102255-0001	3.45	This was at the March election, eighteen fifty five.	7729-102255-0021	7.93	But the affair was magnified as a crowning proof that the free State men were insurrectionists and outlaws.
7729-102255-0001	3.45	This was at the March election, eighteen fifty five.	7729-102255-0023	5.5	Their distinctive characters, however, display one broad and unfailing difference.
7729-102255-0001	3.45	This was at the March election, eighteen fifty five.	7729-102255-0025	5.485	Their assumed character changed with their changing opportunities or necessities.
7729-102255-0001	3.45	This was at the March election, eighteen fifty five.	7729-102255-0028	9.6	Private persons who had leased the Free State Hotel vainly besought the various authorities to prevent the destruction of their property.
7729-102255-0001	3.45	This was at the March election, eighteen fifty five.	7729-102255-0029	7.06	Ten days were consumed in these negotiations; but the spirit of vengeance refused to yield.
7729-102255-0001	3.45	This was at the March election, eighteen fifty five.	7729-102255-0030	7.25	He summoned half a dozen citizens to join his posse, who followed, obeyed, and assisted him.
7729-102255-0001	3.45	This was at the March election, eighteen fifty five.	7729-102255-0031	6.75	He continued his pretended search and, to give color to his errand, made two arrests.
7729-102255-0001	3.45	This was at the March election, eighteen fifty five.	7729-102255-0033	6.775	As he had promised to protect the hotel, the reassured citizens began to laugh at their own fears.
7729-102255-0034	2.71	To their sorrow they were soon undeceived.	7729-102255-0035	5.625	The military force, partly rabble, partly organized, had meanwhile moved into the town.
7729-102255-0012	4.075	Several hundred free State men promptly responded to the summons.	7729-102255-0036	7.705	He planted a company before the hotel, and demanded a surrender of the arms belonging to the free- State military companies.
7729-102255-0001	3.45	This was at the March election, eighteen fifty five.	7729-102255-0038	7.92	Atchison, who had been haranguing the mob, planted his two guns before the building and trained them upon it.
7729-102255-0001	3.45	This was at the March election, eighteen fifty five.	7729-102255-0039	6.815	The inmates being removed, at the appointed hour a few cannon balls were fired through the stone walls.
7729-102255-0001	3.45	This was at the March election, eighteen fifty five.	7729-102255-0045	6.805	Captain Martin said: 'I shall give you a pistol to help protect yourself if worse comes to worst!
3570-5694-0022	4.295	The livery becomes obnoxious to nearly all who are required to wear it.	3570-5695-0000	4.83	In a general way, though not wholly nor consistently, these two groups coincide.
3570-5694-0012	3.205	There is a more or less elaborate system of rank and grades.	3570-5695-0002	7.805	But as we descend the social scale, the point is presently reached where the duties of vicarious leisure and consumption devolve upon the wife alone.
3570-5694-0012	3.205	There is a more or less elaborate system of rank and grades.	3570-5695-0003	5.355	In the communities of the Western culture, this point is at present found among the lower middle class.
3570-5694-0019	3.755	But the general distinction is not on that account to be overlooked.	3570-5695-0006	7.47	Very much of squalor and discomfort will be endured before the last trinket or the last pretense of pecuniary decency is put away.
3570-5694-0019	3.755	But the general distinction is not on that account to be overlooked.	3570-5695-0007	9.755	There is no class and no country that has yielded so abjectly before the pressure of physical want as to deny themselves all gratification of this higher or spiritual need.
3570-5694-0019	3.755	But the general distinction is not on that account to be overlooked.	3570-5695-0008	6.845	The question is, which of the two methods will most effectively reach the persons whose convictions it is desired to affect.
3570-5694-0019	3.755	But the general distinction is not on that account to be overlooked.	3570-5695-0009	5.025	Each will therefore serve about equally well during the earlier stages of social growth.
3570-5694-0019	3.755	But the general distinction is not on that account to be overlooked.	3570-5695-0010	4.665	The modern organization of industry works in the same direction also by another line.
3570-5696-0006	4.16	As used in the speech of everyday life the word carries an undertone of deprecation.	3570-5695-0011	8.26	It is evident, therefore, that the present trend of the development is in the direction of heightening the utility of conspicuous consumption as compared with leisure.
3570-5696-0006	4.16	As used in the speech of everyday life the word carries an undertone of deprecation.	3570-5695-0013	4.64	Consumption becomes a larger element in the standard of living in the city than in the country.
3570-5694-0012	3.205	There is a more or less elaborate system of rank and grades.	3570-5695-0015	7.95	The result is a great mobility of the labor employed in printing; perhaps greater than in any other equally well defined and considerable body of workmen.
260-123440-0008	3.745	I'll try if I know all the things I used to know.	260-123288-0001	5.08	The weather - if we may use that term - will change before long.
260-123288-0020	2.9	Each of us is lashed to some part of the raft.	260-123288-0002	7.25	The atmosphere is charged with vapours, pervaded with the electricity generated by the evaporation of saline waters.
260-123288-0009	3.435	Those clouds seem as if they were going to crush the sea".	260-123288-0003	8.905	The electric light can scarcely penetrate through the dense curtain which has dropped over the theatre on which the battle of the elements is about to be waged.
260-123286-0020	3.06	Tuesday, august eighteenth.	260-123288-0004	4.31	The air is heavy; the sea is calm.
260-123440-0005	3.105	And yesterday things went on just as usual.	260-123288-0006	4.88	The atmosphere is evidently charged and surcharged with electricity.
260-123440-0008	3.745	I'll try if I know all the things I used to know.	260-123288-0008	5.515	There's a heavy storm coming on," I cried, pointing towards the horizon.
260-123440-0006	2.715	I wonder if I've been changed in the night?	260-123288-0011	8.98	But if we have now ceased to advance why do we yet leave that sail loose, which at the first shock of the tempest may capsize us in a moment?
260-123288-0019	2.955	At noon the violence of the storm redoubles.	260-123288-0016	4.865	I refer to the thermometer; it indicates... (the figure is obliterated).
260-123440-0006	2.715	I wonder if I've been changed in the night?	260-123288-0017	5.225	Is the atmospheric condition, having once reached this density, to become final?
260-123440-0005	3.105	And yesterday things went on just as usual.	260-123288-0027	6.305	A suffocating smell of nitrogen fills the air, it enters the throat, it fills the lungs.
8455-210777-0062	3.05	When do you intend that the John Bright shall start"?	8455-210777-0000	8.745	I remained there alone for many hours, but I must acknowledge that before I left the chambers I had gradually brought myself to look at the matter in another light.
8455-210777-0026	3	And the death of which I dreamt could not, alas!	8455-210777-0002	6.24	On arriving at home at my own residence, I found that our salon was filled with a brilliant company.
8455-210777-0026	3	And the death of which I dreamt could not, alas!	8455-210777-0005	5.685	We have our little struggles here as elsewhere, and all things cannot be done by rose water.
8455-210777-0047	2.54	You propose to kidnap me," I said.	8455-210777-0006	4.52	We are quite satisfied now, Captain Battleax," said my wife.
8455-210777-0049	4.11	Lieutenant Crosstrees is a very gallant officer.	8455-210777-0009	4.58	No doubt, in process of time the ladies will follow
8455-210777-0025	3.63	What could I do now but just lay myself down and die?	8455-210777-0011	6.63	I did not mean," said Captain Battleax, "to touch upon public subjects at such a moment as this.
8455-210777-0050	3.945	One of us always remains on board while the other is on shore.	8455-210777-0013	7.41	Jack had been standing in the far corner of the room talking to Eva, and was now reduced to silence by his praises.
8455-210777-0066	2.76	They, of course, must all be altered".	8455-210777-0014	4.12	Sir Kennington Oval is a very fine player," said my wife.
8455-210777-0014	4.12	Sir Kennington Oval is a very fine player," said my wife.	8455-210777-0015	8.615	I and my wife and son, and the two Craswellers, and three or four others, agreed to dine on board the ship on the next.
8455-210777-0026	3	And the death of which I dreamt could not, alas!	8455-210777-0017	5.330063	My wife, on the spur of the moment, managed to give the gentlemen a very good dinner.
8455-210777-0025	3.63	What could I do now but just lay myself down and die?	8455-210777-0018	5.925	This, she said, was true hospitality; and I am not sure that I did not agree with her.
8455-210777-0062	3.05	When do you intend that the John Bright shall start"?	8455-210777-0019	8.105	Then there were three or four leading men of the community, with their wives, who were for the most part the fathers and mothers of the young ladies.
8455-210777-0026	3	And the death of which I dreamt could not, alas!	8455-210777-0023	4.73	We sat with the officers some little time after dinner, and then went ashore.
8455-210777-0043	3.145	But what is the delicate mission"? I asked.	8455-210777-0024	7.56	How much of evil, - of real accomplished evil, - had there not occurred to me during the last few days!
8455-210777-0068	2.59	Your power is sufficient," I said.	8455-210777-0028	7.735	Jack would become Eva's happy husband, and would remain amidst the hurried duties of the eager world.
8455-210777-0025	3.63	What could I do now but just lay myself down and die?	8455-210777-0031	7.67	You have received us with all that courtesy and hospitality for which your character in England stands so high.
8455-210777-0026	3	And the death of which I dreamt could not, alas!	8455-210777-0033	7.51	But your power is so superior to any that I can advance, as to make us here feel that there is no disgrace in yielding to it.
8455-210777-0050	3.945	One of us always remains on board while the other is on shore.	8455-210777-0034	7.7	Not a doubt but had your force been only double or treble our own, I should have found it my duty to struggle with you.
8455-210777-0068	2.59	Your power is sufficient," I said.	8455-210777-0037	4.735	You have come to us threatening us with absolute destruction.
8455-210777-0026	3	And the death of which I dreamt could not, alas!	8455-210777-0039	5.59	I can assure you he has not even allowed me to see the trigger since I have been on board.
8455-210777-0025	3.63	What could I do now but just lay myself down and die?	8455-210777-0040	6.195	Then," said Sir Ferdinando, "there is nothing for it but that he must take you with him".
8455-210777-0026	3	And the death of which I dreamt could not, alas!	8455-210777-0041	6.37	There came upon me a sudden shock when I heard these words, which exceeded anything which I had yet felt.
8455-210777-0050	3.945	One of us always remains on board while the other is on shore.	8455-210777-0044	7.17	I was to be taken away and carried to England or elsewhere, - or drowned upon the voyage, it mattered not which.
8455-210777-0062	3.05	When do you intend that the John Bright shall start"?	8455-210777-0046	9.33	You may be quite sure it's there," said Captain Battleax, "and that I can so use it as to half obliterate your town within two minutes of my return on board".
8455-210777-0020	3.155	Oh yes," said Jack, "and I'm nowhere.	8455-210777-0049	4.11	Lieutenant Crosstrees is a very gallant officer.
8455-210777-0048	3.43	What would become of your gun were I to kidnap you"?	8455-210777-0052	4.94	You will allow me to suggest," said he, "that that is a matter of opinion.
8455-210777-0062	3.05	When do you intend that the John Bright shall start"?	8455-210777-0053	6.955	Were I to comply with your orders without expressing my own opinion, I should seem to have done so willingly hereafter.
8455-210777-0025	3.63	What could I do now but just lay myself down and die?	8455-210777-0055	9.555	SIR, - I have it in command to inform your Excellency that you have been appointed Governor of the Crown colony which is called Britannula.
8455-210777-0025	3.63	What could I do now but just lay myself down and die?	8455-210777-0056	5.545	The peculiar circumstances of the colony are within your Excellency's knowledge.
8455-210777-0050	3.945	One of us always remains on board while the other is on shore.	8455-210777-0058	7.16	It is founded on the acknowledged weakness of those who survive that period of life at which men cease to work.
8455-210777-0064	3.835	And I have no one ready to whom I can give up the archives of the Government".	8455-210777-0059	5.535	But it is surmised that you will find difficulties in the way of your entering at once upon your government.
8455-210777-0062	3.05	When do you intend that the John Bright shall start"?	8455-210777-0060	7.075	The John Bright is armed with a weapon of great power, against which it is impossible that the people of Britannula should prevail.
8455-210777-0064	3.835	And I have no one ready to whom I can give up the archives of the Government".	8455-210777-0069	8.915	If you will give us your promise to meet Captain Battleaxe here at this time tomorrow, we will stretch a point and delay the departure of the John Bright for twenty four hours".
8455-210777-0026	3	And the death of which I dreamt could not, alas!	8455-210777-0070	5.945	And this plan was adopted, too, in order to extract from me a promise that I would depart in peace.
6829-68769-0043	2.59	And he deserves a term in state's prison".	6829-68771-0002	8.94	The "weak kneed" contingency must be strengthened and fortified, and a couple of hundred votes in one way or another secured from the opposition.
6829-68769-0016	4.12	He unlocked the door, and called: "Here's visitors, Tom".	6829-68771-0003	4.015	The Democratic Committee figured out a way to do this.
6829-68769-0014	3.655	They followed the jailer along a succession of passages.	6829-68771-0004	8.44	Under ordinary conditions Reynolds was sure to be elected, but the Committee proposed to sacrifice him in order to elect Hopkins.
6829-68769-0037	2.53	I've seen lots of that kind in my day.	6829-68771-0005	6.165	The only thing necessary was to "fix" Seth Reynolds, and this Hopkins arranged personally.
6829-68769-0012	4.295	Oh, say! that's different," observed Markham, altering his demeanor.	6829-68771-0006	5.92	And this was why Kenneth and Beth discovered him conversing with the young woman in the buggy.
6829-68769-0039	4.045	He looked up rather ungraciously, but motioned them to be seated.	6829-68771-0008	7.18	These women were flattered by the attention of the young lady and had promised to assist in electing mister Forbes.
6829-68769-0051	3.545	There was a grim smile of amusement on his shrewd face.	6829-68771-0010	9.82	The Fairview band was engaged to discourse as much harmony as it could produce, and the resources of the great house were taxed to entertain the guests.
6829-68769-0037	2.53	I've seen lots of that kind in my day.	6829-68771-0011	5.625	Tables were spread on the lawn and a dainty but substantial repast was to be served.
6829-68769-0028	3.29	He is supposed to sign all the checks of the concern.	6829-68771-0014	4.77	We ought to have more attendants, Beth," said Louise, approaching her cousin.
6829-68769-0033	4.02	It was better for him to think the girl unfeeling than to know the truth.	6829-68771-0015	4.525	Won't you run into the house and see if Martha can't spare one or two more maids"?
6829-68769-0035	2.755	It won't be much, but I'm grateful to find a friend.	6829-68771-0016	6.99	She was very fond of the young ladies, whom she had known when Aunt Jane was the mistress here, and Beth was her especial favorite.
6829-68771-0021	2.61	But it can't be," protested the girl.	6829-68771-0018	8.445	For a moment Beth stood staring, while the new maid regarded her with composure and a slight smile upon her beautiful face.
6829-68771-0031	2.515	Her eyes wandered to the maid's hands.	6829-68771-0019	7.42	She was dressed in the regulation costume of the maids at Elmhurst, a plain black gown with white apron and cap.
6829-68771-0022	3.8	I attend to the household mending, you know, and care for the linen.	6829-68771-0020	4.615	Then she gave a little laugh, and replied: "No, Miss Beth. I'm Elizabeth Parsons".
6829-68769-0012	4.295	Oh, say! that's different," observed Markham, altering his demeanor.	6829-68771-0023	5.425	You speak like an educated person," said Beth, wonderingly. "Where is your home"?
6829-68771-0035	4.39	Will you leave me alone in my own room, or must I go away to escape you"?	6829-68771-0024	6.245	For the first time the maid seemed a little confused, and her gaze wandered from the face of her visitor.
6829-68769-0051	3.545	There was a grim smile of amusement on his shrewd face.	6829-68771-0025	7.83	She sat down in a rocking chair, and clasping her hands in her lap, rocked slowly back and forth. "I'm sorry," said Beth.
6829-68769-0051	3.545	There was a grim smile of amusement on his shrewd face.	6829-68771-0027	5.32	They - they excite me, in some way, and I - I can't bear them. You must excuse me".
6829-68771-0035	4.39	Will you leave me alone in my own room, or must I go away to escape you"?	6829-68771-0029	8.945	Beth was a beautiful girl - the handsomest of the three cousins, by far; yet Eliza surpassed her in natural charm, and seemed well aware of the fact.
6829-68769-0003	4.215	It was a deliberate theft from his employers to protect a girl he loved.	6829-68771-0030	6.225	Her manner was neither independent nor assertive, but rather one of well bred composure and calm reliance.
6829-68769-0002	3.075	I can't see it in that light," said the old lawyer.	6829-68771-0032	6.555	However her features and form might repress any evidence of nervousness, these hands told a different story.
6829-68771-0034	2.475	I wish I knew myself," she cried, fiercely.	6829-68771-0033	5.45	She rose quickly to her feet, with an impetuous gesture that made her visitor catch her breath.
6829-68769-0002	3.075	I can't see it in that light," said the old lawyer.	6829-68771-0035	4.39	Will you leave me alone in my own room, or must I go away to escape you"?
6829-68769-0028	3.29	He is supposed to sign all the checks of the concern.	6829-68771-0036	5.2	Eliza closed the door behind her with a decided slam, and a key clicked in the lock.
8463-287645-0008	3.325	As usual nothing was done in the way of punishment".	8463-287645-0000	4.73	This was what did the mischief so far as the "running away" was concerned.
8463-294828-0008	2.65	And yet, what a fine, gallant lad!	8463-287645-0003	7.905	Of this party, Edward, a boy of seventeen, called forth much sympathy; he too was claimed by Hollan.
8463-294828-0026	2.745	We have a commander who's game for anything"!	8463-287645-0006	7.71	The doctor who attended the injured creature in this case was simply told that she slipped and fell down stairs as she was coming down.
8463-294828-0021	2.735	A route slightly less direct, that's all.	8463-287645-0010	4.325	He worked me very hard; he wanted to be beating me all the time".
8463-287645-0008	3.325	As usual nothing was done in the way of punishment".	8463-287645-0011	6.38	She was a large, homely woman; they were common white people, with no reputation in the community".
8463-294828-0011	3.91	He went here, there, and everywhere in perfect contentment.	8463-287645-0012	5.425	Substantially this was Jacob's unvarnished description of his master and mistress.
8463-294828-0032	4.395	In person. Welcome aboard, professor. Your cabin is waiting for you".	8463-287645-0013	6.665	As to his age, and also the name of his master, Jacob's statement varied somewhat from the advertisement.
3729-6852-0016	4.195	Madame Quinson, besides, can answer your enquiries.	3729-6852-0011	7.37	I had a name, I believe, in my young days, but I have forgotten it since I have been in service.
3729-6852-0010	2.755	I never had any family.	3729-6852-0014	5.71	Here, go and get me change for a Louis". "I have it, sir".
3729-6852-0025	3	Is there not a meridian everywhere"?	3729-6852-0016	4.195	Madame Quinson, besides, can answer your enquiries.
3729-6852-0016	4.195	Madame Quinson, besides, can answer your enquiries.	3729-6852-0018	6.21	I sit down at a small table: a waiter comes immediately to enquire my wishes.
3729-6852-0019	3.305	I tell him to give me some coffee, if it is good.	3729-6852-0022	8.315	I address him in Italian, and he answers very wittily, but his way of speaking makes me smile, and I tell him why.
3729-6852-0019	3.305	I tell him to give me some coffee, if it is good.	3729-6852-0023	8.185	My remark pleases him, but I soon prove to him that it is not the right way to speak, however perfect may have been the language of that ancient writer.
3729-6852-0019	3.305	I tell him to give me some coffee, if it is good.	3729-6852-0024	5.515	I see a crowd in one corner of the garden, everybody standing still and looking up.
3729-6852-0016	4.195	Madame Quinson, besides, can answer your enquiries.	3729-6852-0026	4.69	Yes, but the meridian of the Palais Royal is the most exact".
3729-6852-0019	3.305	I tell him to give me some coffee, if it is good.	3729-6852-0028	5.265	All these honest persons are waiting their turn to get their snuff boxes filled".
3729-6852-0010	2.755	I never had any family.	3729-6852-0029	8.605	It is sold everywhere, but for the last three weeks nobody will use any snuff but that sold at the 'Civet Cat.
3729-6852-0025	3	Is there not a meridian everywhere"?	3729-6852-0031	4.4	But how did she manage to render it so fashionable"?
3729-6852-0019	3.305	I tell him to give me some coffee, if it is good.	3729-6852-0037	5.89	She introduced me to all her guests, and gave me some particulars respecting every one of them.
3729-6852-0021	2.96	I thank him and take my leave.	3729-6852-0038	5.77	What, sir"! I said to him, "am I fortunate enough to see you?
3729-6852-0019	3.305	I tell him to give me some coffee, if it is good.	3729-6852-0039	8.825	He himself recited the same passage in French, and politely pointed out the parts in which he thought that I had improved on the original.
3729-6852-0019	3.305	I tell him to give me some coffee, if it is good.	3729-6852-0044	6.98	I will make you translate them into French, and you need not be afraid of my finding you insatiable".
7176-92135-0026	2.95	Enter Hamlet with his favourite boar hound.	7176-88083-0000	5.695	All about him was a tumult of bright and broken color, scattered in broad splashes.
7176-92135-0039	3.125	Tea, please, Matthews. Butler (impassively).	7176-88083-0002	7.51	His feet were red, his long narrow beak, with its saw toothed edges and sharp hooked tip, was bright red.
7176-92135-0024	4.1	To be or not to be, that is the question; whether 'tis nobler	7176-88083-0003	7.6	But here he was at a terrible disadvantage as compared with the owls, hawks, and eagles. He had no rending claws.
7176-88083-0016	3.92	Straightway the hawk glided from his perch and darted after him.	7176-88083-0004	7.5	But suddenly, straight and swift as a diving cormorant, he shot down into the torrent and disappeared beneath the surface.
7176-88083-0016	3.92	Straightway the hawk glided from his perch and darted after him.	7176-88083-0005	4.7	Once fairly a wing, however, he wheeled and made back hurriedly for his perch.
7176-92135-0008	4.43	Lend me your ear for ten minutes, and you shall learn just what stagecraft is".	7176-88083-0006	4.295	It might have seemed that a trout of this size was a fairly substantial meal.
7176-92135-0008	4.43	Lend me your ear for ten minutes, and you shall learn just what stagecraft is".	7176-88083-0009	4.045	The great hawk followed hurriedly, to retrieve his prey from the ground.
7176-88083-0008	3.28	In despair he hurled himself downward too soon.	7176-88083-0010	6.74	The cat growled softly, picked up the prize in her jaws and trotted into the bushes to devour it.
7176-88083-0016	3.92	Straightway the hawk glided from his perch and darted after him.	7176-88083-0012	5.045	The hawk alighted on the dead branch, and sat upright, motionless, as if surprised.
7176-88083-0009	4.045	The great hawk followed hurriedly, to retrieve his prey from the ground.	7176-88083-0014	4.67	The hawk sat upon the branch and watched his quarry swimming beneath the surface.
7176-88083-0016	3.92	Straightway the hawk glided from his perch and darted after him.	7176-88083-0019	5.81	As he flew, his down reaching, clutching talons were not half a yard above the fugitive's head.
7176-88083-0009	4.045	The great hawk followed hurriedly, to retrieve his prey from the ground.	7176-88083-0020	5.415	Where the waves for an instant sank, they came closer, - but not quite within grasping reach.
7176-92135-0024	4.1	To be or not to be, that is the question; whether 'tis nobler	7176-88083-0022	9.485	The hawk, embittered by the loss of his first quarry, had become as dogged in pursuit as a weasel, not to be shaken off or evaded or deceived.
7176-88083-0016	3.92	Straightway the hawk glided from his perch and darted after him.	7176-88083-0023	9.645	He had a lot of line out, and the place was none too free for a long cast; but he was impatient to drop his flies again on the spot where the big fish was feeding.
7176-92135-0024	4.1	To be or not to be, that is the question; whether 'tis nobler	7176-88083-0024	8.195	The last drop fly, as luck would have it, caught just in the corner of the hawk's angrily open beak, hooking itself firmly.
7176-88083-0006	4.295	It might have seemed that a trout of this size was a fairly substantial meal.	7176-88083-0025	7.38	At the sudden sharp sting of it, the great bird turned his head and noticed, for the first time, the fisherman standing on the bank.
7176-88083-0009	4.045	The great hawk followed hurriedly, to retrieve his prey from the ground.	7176-88083-0026	5.53	The drag upon his beak and the light check upon his wings were inexplicable to him, and appalling.
7127-75947-0008	4.155	The arrow pierced his heart and wounded him mortally.	7127-75946-0004	4.49	Certainly, sire; but I must have money to do that". "What!
7127-75947-0035	4.415	Good gracious! has the king any right to interfere in matters of that kind?	7127-75946-0006	7.98	He has given them with too much grace not to have others still to give, if they are required, which is the case at the present moment.
7127-75947-0017	2.665	What, already here"! they said to her.	7127-75946-0007	4.755	It is necessary, therefore, that he should comply". The king frowned.
7127-75947-0030	2.76	She was here just now," said the count.	7127-75946-0008	4.46	Does your majesty then no longer believe the disloyal attempt"?
7127-75946-0005	2.67	What do you mean"? inquired Louis,	7127-75946-0009	4.72	Not at all; you are, on the contrary, most agreeable to me".
7127-75947-0011	3.62	Remain, I implore you: the evening is most lovely.	7127-75946-0012	9.87	The news circulated with the rapidity of lightning; during its progress it kindled every variety of coquetry, desire, and wild ambition.
7127-75947-0002	3.235	Do you think so"? she replied with indifference.	7127-75946-0013	8.58	The king had completed his toilette by nine o'clock; he appeared in an open carriage decorated with branches of trees and flowers.
7127-75947-0018	4.04	I have been here this quarter of an hour," replied La Valliere.	7127-75946-0015	7.515	Suddenly, for the purpose of restoring peace and order, Spring, accompanied by his whole court, made his appearance.
7127-75947-0018	4.04	I have been here this quarter of an hour," replied La Valliere.	7127-75946-0018	9.14	There was something in his carriage which resembled the buoyant movements of an immortal, and he did not dance so much as seem to soar along.
7127-75947-0018	4.04	I have been here this quarter of an hour," replied La Valliere.	7127-75946-0020	6.52	Far from it, sire; your majesty having given no directions about it, the musicians have retained it".
7127-75947-0002	3.235	Do you think so"? she replied with indifference.	7127-75946-0024	5.09	Monsieur was the only one who did not understand anything about the matter.
7127-75947-0018	4.04	I have been here this quarter of an hour," replied La Valliere.	7127-75946-0027	9.675	Disdainful of a success of which Madame showed no acknowledgement, he thought of nothing but boldly regaining the marked preference of the princess.
7127-75946-0023	3.745	The king seemed only pleased with every one present.	7127-75946-0029	9.285	The king, who had from this moment become in reality the principal dancer in the quadrille, cast a look upon his vanquished rival.
5105-28240-0018	2.885	You will take me on board, count, will you not"?	5105-28241-0000	6.455	Her sea going qualities were excellent, and would have amply sufficed for a circumnavigation of the globe.
5105-28240-0016	4.17	To all these inquiries, the count responded in the affirmative.	5105-28241-0005	8.415	For a few miles she followed the line hitherto presumably occupied by the coast of Algeria; but no land appeared to the south.
5105-28233-0001	4.49	He seemed born to please without being conscious of the power he possessed.	5105-28241-0006	7.55	The log and the compass, therefore, were able to be called upon to do the work of the sextant, which had become utterly useless.
5105-28240-0002	4.01	exclaimed Servadac, keeping his eye unmoved at his telescope.	5105-28241-0008	8.54	The earth has undoubtedly entered upon a new orbit, but she is not incurring any probable risk of being precipitated onto the sun".
5105-28240-0013	2.96	Nothing more than you know yourself".	5105-28241-0009	7.01	And what demonstration do you offer," asked Servadac eagerly, "that it will not happen"?
5105-28240-0010	2.935	Captain Servadac hastened towards him.	5105-28241-0012	6.775	Is it not impossible," he murmured aloud, "that any city should disappear so completely?
5105-28241-0014	2.995	Another circumstance was most remarkable.	5105-28241-0013	4.82	Would not the loftiest eminences of the city at least be visible?
5105-28240-0018	2.885	You will take me on board, count, will you not"?	5105-28241-0016	6.285	You must see, lieutenant, I should think, that we are not so near the coast of Algeria as you imagined".
5105-28240-0018	2.885	You will take me on board, count, will you not"?	5105-28241-0019	5.29	Nothing was to be done but to put about, and return in disappointment towards the north.
7021-85628-0004	2.805	Yes, why not"? thought Anders.	7021-79759-0000	4.775	Nature of the Effect produced by Early Impressions.
7021-79740-0009	3.635	They were now playing with their dolls in the parlor.	7021-79759-0002	5.25	They are chiefly formed from combinations of the impressions made in childhood.
7021-79759-0001	2.48	That is comparatively nothing.	7021-79759-0003	4.62	Vast Importance and Influence of this mental Furnishing,
1320-122617-0041	4.15	Uncas cast his skin, and stepped forth in his own beautiful proportions.	1320-122612-0001	9.52	The dews were suffered to exhale, and the sun had dispersed the mists, and was shedding a strong and clear light in the forest, when the travelers resumed their journey.
1320-122612-0014	3.515	The examination, however, resulted in no discovery.	1320-122612-0002	7.46	After proceeding a few miles, the progress of Hawkeye, who led the advance, became more deliberate and watchful.
1320-122617-0005	4.4	The bear shook his shaggy sides, and then a well known voice replied:	1320-122612-0003	9.865	He often stopped to examine the trees; nor did he cross a rivulet without attentively considering the quantity, the velocity, and the color of its waters.
1320-122617-0005	4.4	The bear shook his shaggy sides, and then a well known voice replied:	1320-122612-0004	6.425	Distrusting his own judgment, his appeals to the opinion of Chingachgook were frequent and earnest.
1320-122612-0009	3.88	It would have been more wonderful had he spoken without a bidding.	1320-122612-0005	5.915	Yet here are we, within a short range of the Scaroons, and not a sign of a trail have we crossed!
1320-122617-0030	3.98	So choose for yourself to make a rush or tarry here".	1320-122612-0006	4.845	Let us retrace our steps, and examine as we go, with keener eyes.
1320-122612-0014	3.515	The examination, however, resulted in no discovery.	1320-122612-0007	5.54	Chingachgook had caught the look, and motioning with his hand, he bade him speak.
1320-122612-0009	3.88	It would have been more wonderful had he spoken without a bidding.	1320-122612-0008	7.875	The eyes of the whole party followed the unexpected movement, and read their success in the air of triumph that the youth assumed.
1320-122612-0009	3.88	It would have been more wonderful had he spoken without a bidding.	1320-122612-0013	6.55	A circle of a few hundred feet in circumference was drawn, and each of the party took a segment for his portion.
1320-122617-0041	4.15	Uncas cast his skin, and stepped forth in his own beautiful proportions.	1320-122612-0015	6.385	The whole party crowded to the spot where Uncas pointed out the impression of a moccasin in the moist alluvion.
5142-33396-0028	3.755	On a bench in a far corner were a dozen people huddled together.	5142-33396-0001	5.02	What is your country, Olaf? Have you always been a thrall"? The thrall's eyes flashed.
5142-33396-0010	3.455	In the stern I curved the tail up almost as high as the head.	5142-33396-0006	6.23	I made her for only twenty oars because I thought few men would follow me; for I was young, fifteen years old.
5142-33396-0003	3.47	The rest of you, off a viking'! "He had three ships.	5142-33396-0007	4.975	At the prow I carved the head with open mouth and forked tongue thrust out.
5142-33396-0050	2.885	May you drink heart's ease from it for many years.	5142-33396-0012	4.59	Then I will get me a farm and will winter in that land. Now who will follow me?
5142-33396-0021	3.505	Up and down the water we went to get much wealth and much frolic.	5142-33396-0015	4.31	As our boat flashed down the rollers into the water I made this song and sang it:
5142-33396-0014	3.245	Thirty men, one after another, raised their horns and said:	5142-33396-0019	4.985	Oh! it is better to live on the sea and let other men raise your crops and cook your meals.
5142-33396-0036	4.26	So I will give out this law: that my men shall never leave you alone.	5142-33396-0022	4.77	What of the farm, Olaf'? "'Not yet,' I answered. 'Viking is better for summer.
5142-33396-0047	2.535	My men pounded the table with their fists.	5142-33396-0024	5.345	I stood with my back to the wall; for I wanted no sword reaching out of the dark for me.
5142-33396-0037	3.575	Hakon there shall be your constant companion, friend farmer.	5142-33396-0031	7.845	They set up a crane over the fire and hung the pot upon it, and we sat and watched it boil while we joked. At last the supper began.
5142-33396-0010	3.455	In the stern I curved the tail up almost as high as the head.	5142-33396-0032	9.785	The farmer sat gloomily on the bench and would not eat, and you cannot wonder; for he saw us putting potfuls of his good beef and basket loads of bread into our big mouths.
5142-33396-0050	2.885	May you drink heart's ease from it for many years.	5142-33396-0033	5.28	You would not eat with us. You cannot say no to half of my ale. I drink this to your health.
5142-33396-0009	3.37	There, stand so'! I said, 'and glare and hiss at my foes.	5142-33396-0034	6.615	Then I drank half of the hornful and sent the rest across the fire to the farmer. He took it and smiled, saying:
5142-36586-0000	3.65	It is manifest that man is now subject to much variability.	5142-33396-0036	4.26	So I will give out this law: that my men shall never leave you alone.
5142-33396-0060	2.615	Take him out, Thorkel, and let him taste your sword.	5142-33396-0038	4.18	He shall not leave you day or night, whether you are working or playing or sleeping.
5142-33396-0030	2.765	The thralls were bringing in a great pot of meat.	5142-33396-0042	6.095	So no tales got out to the neighbors. Besides, it was a lonely place, and by good luck no one came that way.
5142-33396-0030	2.765	The thralls were bringing in a great pot of meat.	5142-33396-0044	4.855	I am stiff with long sitting,' he said. 'I itch for a fight'. "I turned to the farmer.
5142-33396-0014	3.245	Thirty men, one after another, raised their horns and said:	5142-33396-0051	5.57	And with it I leave you a name, Sif the Friendly. I shall hope to drink with you sometime in Valhalla.
5142-33396-0060	2.615	Take him out, Thorkel, and let him taste your sword.	5142-33396-0052	5.88	Here is a ring for Sif the Friendly'. "'And here is a bracelet'. "'A sword would not be ashamed to hang at your side.
5142-33396-0049	3.305	Here, friend, take it,' and he thrust it into the farmer's hand.	5142-33396-0054	5.745	That is the best way to decide, for the spear will always point somewhere, and one thing is as good as another.
5142-33396-0050	2.885	May you drink heart's ease from it for many years.	5142-33396-0059	5.47	Yes. And with all your fingers it took you a year to catch me'. "The king frowned more angrily.
5142-33396-0025	3.32	Come, come'! I called, when no one obeyed. 'A fire!	5142-33396-0065	5.195	Soft heart'! he said gently to her; then to Thorkel, 'Well, let him go, Thorkel!
5142-33396-0049	3.305	Here, friend, take it,' and he thrust it into the farmer's hand.	5142-33396-0067	5.565	But, young sharp tongue, now that we have caught you we will put you into a trap that you cannot get out of.
5683-32866-0000	2.645	Miss Lake declined the carriage to night.	5683-32879-0000	8.92	It was not very much past eleven that morning when the pony carriage from Brandon drew up before the little garden wicket of Redman's Farm.
5683-32879-0022	4.175	I like you still, Rachel; I'm sure I'll always like you.	5683-32879-0003	9.345	Women can hide their pain better than we men, and bear it better, too, except when shame drops fire into the dreadful chalice.
5683-32866-0001	3.47	And he added something still less complimentary.	5683-32879-0005	6.11	This transient spring and lighting up are beautiful - a glamour beguiling our senses.
5683-32865-0001	2.58	said Lord Chelford, addressing me.	5683-32879-0007	6.795	Rachel's pale and sharpened features and dilated eye struck her with a painful surprise.
5683-32879-0008	2.95	You have been so ill, my poor Rachel.	5683-32879-0009	5.135	Ill and troubled, dear - troubled in mind, and miserably nervous.
5683-32866-0006	4.215	Yes, so they said; but that would, I think, have been worse.	5683-32879-0010	7.75	Poor Rachel! her nature recoiled from deceit, and she told, at all events, as much of the truth as she dared.
5683-32865-0014	2.615	He's not a man for country quarters!	5683-32879-0011	9.21	She spoke with a sudden energy, which partook of fear and passion, and flushed her thin cheek, and made her languid eyes flash.
5683-32865-0015	4.145	I had a horrid dream about him last night.' That?	5683-32879-0012	4.38	Thank you, Rachel, my Cousin Rachel, my only friend.
5683-32879-0001	3.66	Well, she was better, though she had had a bad night.	5683-32879-0014	8.405	Yes, something - everything,' said Rachel, hurriedly, looking frowningly at a flower which she was twirling in her fingers.
5683-32866-0023	2.745	All the furniture belonged to other times.	5683-32879-0018	7.44	It is an antipathy - an antipathy I cannot get over, dear Dorcas; you may think it a madness, but don't blame me.
5683-32866-0007	4.12	If a fellow's been a little bit wild, he's Beelzebub at once.	5683-32879-0019	6.35	I have very few to love me now, and I thought you might love me, as I have begun to love you.
5683-32865-0014	2.615	He's not a man for country quarters!	5683-32879-0020	6.545	And she threw her arms round her cousin's neck, and brave Rachel at last burst into tears.
5683-32865-0006	3.35	At dinner Lake was easy and amusing.	5683-32879-0021	4.09	Dorcas, in her strange way, was moved.
5683-32865-0003	3.51	They are cousins, you know; we are all cousins.	5683-32879-0022	4.175	I like you still, Rachel; I'm sure I'll always like you.
5683-32866-0001	3.47	And he added something still less complimentary.	5683-32879-0023	4.975	You resemble me, Rachel: you are fearless and inflexible and generous.
1580-141084-0003	4.1	No names, please"! said Holmes, as we knocked at Gilchrist's door.	1580-141084-0000	4.615	It was the Indian, whose dark silhouette appeared suddenly upon his blind.
1580-141084-0034	4.49	Well, well, don't trouble to answer. Listen, and see that I do you no injustice.	1580-141084-0002	5.905	This set of rooms is quite the oldest in the college, and it is not unusual for visitors to go over them.
1580-141083-0041	3.575	Let us hear the suspicions. I will look after the proofs".	1580-141084-0003	4.1	No names, please"! said Holmes, as we knocked at Gilchrist's door.
1580-141083-0050	3.085	I really don't think he knew much about it, mister Holmes.	1580-141084-0004	9.005	Of course, he did not realize that it was I who was knocking, but none the less his conduct was very uncourteous, and, indeed, under the circumstances rather suspicious".
1580-141083-0046	3.53	But I have occasionally done the same thing at other times".	1580-141084-0008	6.795	I cannot allow the examination to be held if one of the papers has been tampered with. The situation must be faced".
1580-141083-0021	3.715	There is no opening except the one pane," said our learned guide.	1580-141084-0009	4.685	It is possible that I may be in a position then to indicate some course of action.
1580-141084-0037	2.965	When I approached your room, I examined the window.	1580-141084-0011	5	When we were out in the darkness of the quadrangle, we again looked up at the windows.
1580-141084-0045	3.625	Suddenly he heard him at the very door. There was no possible escape.	1580-141084-0016	5.96	My friend did not appear to be depressed by his failure, but shrugged his shoulders in half humorous resignation.
1580-141083-0016	4.255	I was in such a hurry to come to you". "You left your door open"?	1580-141084-0021	4.01	On the palm were three little pyramids of black, doughy clay.
1580-141083-0030	3.48	mister Soames was somewhat overwhelmed by this flood of information.	1580-141084-0023	8.735	In a few hours the examination would commence, and he was still in the dilemma between making the facts public and allowing the culprit to compete for the valuable scholarship.
1580-141083-0046	3.53	But I have occasionally done the same thing at other times".	1580-141084-0024	9.185	He could hardly stand still so great was his mental agitation, and he ran towards Holmes with two eager hands outstretched. "Thank heaven that you have come!
1580-141083-0025	3.905	The man entered and took the papers, sheet by sheet, from the central table.	1580-141084-0026	6.995	If this matter is not to become public, we must give ourselves certain powers and resolve ourselves into a small private court martial.
1580-141083-0046	3.53	But I have occasionally done the same thing at other times".	1580-141084-0029	8.075	His troubled blue eyes glanced at each of us, and finally rested with an expression of blank dismay upon Bannister in the farther corner.
1580-141083-0050	3.085	I really don't think he knew much about it, mister Holmes.	1580-141084-0031	6.47	We want to know, mister Gilchrist, how you, an honourable man, ever came to commit such an action as that of yesterday"?
1580-141083-0028	2.585	Then he tossed it down and seized the next.	1580-141084-0032	4.995	For a moment Gilchrist, with upraised hand, tried to control his writhing features.
1580-141083-0040	3.75	One hardly likes to throw suspicion where there are no proofs".	1580-141084-0033	7	Come, come," said Holmes, kindly, "it is human to err, and at least no one can accuse you of being a callous criminal.
1580-141083-0036	3.98	Holmes held it out on his open palm in the glare of the electric light.	1580-141084-0034	4.49	Well, well, don't trouble to answer. Listen, and see that I do you no injustice.
1580-141084-0035	2.63	He could examine the papers in his own office.	1580-141084-0039	4.885	I entered, and I took you into my confidence as to the suggestions of the side table.
1580-141084-0035	2.63	He could examine the papers in his own office.	1580-141084-0040	5.985	He returned carrying his jumping shoes, which are provided, as you are aware, with several sharp spikes.
1580-141084-0045	3.625	Suddenly he heard him at the very door. There was no possible escape.	1580-141084-0041	7.99	No harm would have been done had it not been that, as he passed your door, he perceived the key which had been left by the carelessness of your servant.
1580-141083-0024	4.48	You left him in a chair, you say. Which chair"? "By the window there".	1580-141084-0042	5.06	A sudden impulse came over him to enter, and see if they were indeed the proofs.
1580-141083-0030	3.48	mister Soames was somewhat overwhelmed by this flood of information.	1580-141084-0047	5.25	I have a letter here, mister Soames, which I wrote to you early this morning in the middle of a restless night.
1580-141084-0045	3.625	Suddenly he heard him at the very door. There was no possible escape.	1580-141084-0048	9.265	It will be clear to you, from what I have said, that only you could have let this young man out, since you were left in the room, and must have locked the door when you went out.
1580-141083-0024	4.48	You left him in a chair, you say. Which chair"? "By the window there".	1580-141084-0049	7.575	It was simple enough, sir, if you only had known, but, with all your cleverness, it was impossible that you could know.
6930-76324-0010	2.69	What in the world is that"? queried Joyce.	6930-75918-0002	5.025	Congratulations were poured in upon the princess everywhere during her journey.
6930-76324-0013	4.305	It can't hurt anything, I'm sure, for we won't disturb things at all.	6930-75918-0006	5.85	This has indeed been a harassing day," continued the young man, his eyes fixed upon his friend.
6930-75918-0000	3.505	Concord returned to its place amidst the tents.	6930-75918-0008	4.785	Can you imagine why Buckingham has been so violent"? "I suspect".
6930-76324-0019	2.575	Now let's dust the furniture and pictures".	6930-75918-0009	7.28	It is you who are mistaken, Raoul; I have read his distress in his eyes, in his every gesture and action the whole day".
6930-75918-0000	3.505	Concord returned to its place amidst the tents.	6930-75918-0015	6.38	Thus it is that the honor of three is saved: our country's, our master's, and our own.
6930-76324-0013	4.305	It can't hurt anything, I'm sure, for we won't disturb things at all.	6930-75918-0017	6.16	But in this friendly pressure Raoul could detect the nervous agitation of a great internal conflict.
4077-13751-0019	2.92	Who began the quarrel? Was it the "Mormons"?	4077-13754-0000	4.78	The army found the people in poverty, and left them in comparative wealth.
4077-13751-0013	4.315	Their sufferings have never yet been fitly chronicled by human scribe.	4077-13754-0003	5.68	Moreover, had the people been inclined to rebellion what greater opportunity could they have wished?
4077-13754-0001	3.77	But a word further concerning the expedition in general.	4077-13754-0004	4.985	Already a North and a South were talked of - why not set up also a West?
4077-13751-0013	4.315	Their sufferings have never yet been fitly chronicled by human scribe.	4077-13754-0009	7.65	At the inception of plural marriage among the Latter day Saints, there was no law, national or state, against its practise.
1995-1837-0015	4.485	The squares of cotton, sharp edged, heavy, were just about to burst to bolls!	1995-1826-0000	9.485	In the debate between the senior societies her defence of the Fifteenth Amendment had been not only a notable bit of reasoning, but delivered with real enthusiasm.
1995-1837-0015	4.485	The squares of cotton, sharp edged, heavy, were just about to burst to bolls!	1995-1826-0002	4.605	John Taylor, who had supported her through college, was interested in cotton.
1995-1837-0000	3.865	He knew the Silver Fleece - his and Zora's - must be ruined.	1995-1826-0005	5.125	But, John, there's no society - just elementary work
1995-1837-0013	3.195	Then he looked down. The lagoon was dry.	1995-1826-0009	7.57	You ought to know, John, if I teach Negroes I'll scarcely see much of people in my own class".
1995-1837-0020	3.21	The years of the days of her dying were ten.	1995-1826-0011	8.94	Here she was teaching dirty children, and the smell of confused odors and bodily perspiration was to her at times unbearable.
1995-1836-0007	3.435	But you believe in some education"? asked Mary Taylor.	1995-1826-0012	6.18	She wanted a glance of the new books and periodicals and talk of great philanthropies and reforms.
1995-1837-0009	3.76	The lagoon had been level with the dykes a week ago; and now?	1995-1826-0013	8.77	So for the hundredth time she was thinking today, as she walked alone up the lane back of the barn, and then slowly down through the bottoms.
1995-1826-0015	3.55	She had almost forgotten that it was here within touch and sight.	1995-1826-0016	5.9	The glimmering sea of delicate leaves whispered and murmured before her, stretching away to the Northward.
1995-1837-0022	3.415	Up in the sick room Zora lay on the little white bed.	1995-1826-0017	6.145	There might be a bit of poetry here and there, but most of this place was such desperate prose.
1995-1837-0015	4.485	The squares of cotton, sharp edged, heavy, were just about to burst to bolls!	1995-1826-0018	5.01	Her regard shifted to the green stalks and leaves again, and she started to move away.
1995-1826-0004	3.035	Might learn something useful down there".	1995-1826-0019	5.25	Cotton is a wonderful thing, is it not, boys"? she said rather primly.
1995-1837-0011	3.375	He started at the thought. He hurried forth sadly.	1995-1826-0020	6.12	Miss Taylor did not know much about cotton, but at least one more remark seemed called for.
1995-1826-0003	3.09	Better go," he had counselled, sententiously.	1995-1826-0022	4.745	I suppose, though, it's too early for them". Then came the explosion.
1995-1837-0002	2.79	Ah! the swamp, the cruel swamp!	1995-1826-0024	5.095	The Golden Fleece - it's the Silver Fleece"! He harkened.
5683-32866-0001	3.47	And he added something still less complimentary.	5683-32865-0004	7.365	Whatever Lord Chelford said, Miss Brandon received it very graciously, and even with a momentary smile.
5683-32865-0002	2.78	He had his hand upon Lake's shoulder.	5683-32865-0007	6.065	I'm glad you like it,' says Wylder, chuckling benignantly on it, over his shoulder.
5683-32866-0001	3.47	And he added something still less complimentary.	5683-32865-0008	6.12	I believe I have a little taste that way; those are all real, you know, those jewels.
5683-32866-0000	2.645	Miss Lake declined the carriage to night.	5683-32865-0009	9.89	And he placed it in that gentleman's fingers, who now took his turn at the lamp, and contemplated the little parallelogram with a gleam of sly amusement.
5683-32866-0006	4.215	Yes, so they said; but that would, I think, have been worse.	5683-32865-0010	6.335	I was thinking it's very like the ace of hearts,' answered the captain softly, smiling on.
5683-32865-0003	3.51	They are cousins, you know; we are all cousins.	5683-32865-0011	6.355	Whereupon Lake laughed quietly, still looking on the ace of hearts with his sly eyes.
5683-32865-0015	4.145	I had a horrid dream about him last night.' That?	5683-32865-0013	7.095	Do you know?' 'Lake? Oh! I really can't tell; but he'll soon tire of country life.
5683-32879-0012	4.38	Thank you, Rachel, my Cousin Rachel, my only friend.	5683-32865-0015	4.145	I had a horrid dream about him last night.' That?
5683-32866-0006	4.215	Yes, so they said; but that would, I think, have been worse.	5683-32865-0017	5.455	All the time he was talking to me his angry little eyes were following Lake.
1320-122617-0005	4.4	The bear shook his shaggy sides, and then a well known voice replied:	1320-122617-0000	7.835	Notwithstanding the high resolution of Hawkeye he fully comprehended all the difficulties and danger he was about to incur.
1320-122617-0022	3.855	The Delawares are children of the tortoise, and they outstrip the deer".	1320-122617-0003	6.285	There was something in his air and manner that betrayed to the scout the utter confusion of the state of his mind.
1320-122617-0008	4.185	The young man is in bondage, and much I fear his death is decreed.	1320-122617-0005	4.4	The bear shook his shaggy sides, and then a well known voice replied:
1320-122612-0016	3.49	Run back, Uncas, and bring me the size of the singer's foot.	1320-122617-0006	5.655	Can these things be"? returned David, breathing more freely, as the truth began to dawn upon him.
1320-122617-0005	4.4	The bear shook his shaggy sides, and then a well known voice replied:	1320-122617-0008	4.185	The young man is in bondage, and much I fear his death is decreed.
1320-122612-0009	3.88	It would have been more wonderful had he spoken without a bidding.	1320-122617-0009	7.705	I greatly mourn that one so well disposed should die in his ignorance, and I have sought a goodly hymn-" "Can you lead me to him"?
1320-122617-0005	4.4	The bear shook his shaggy sides, and then a well known voice replied:	1320-122617-0010	10	The task will not be difficult," returned David, hesitating; "though I greatly fear your presence would rather increase than mitigate his unhappy fortunes".
1320-122617-0022	3.855	The Delawares are children of the tortoise, and they outstrip the deer".	1320-122617-0011	9.76	The lodge in which Uncas was confined was in the very center of the village, and in a situation, perhaps, more difficult than any other to approach, or leave, without observation.
1320-122617-0041	4.15	Uncas cast his skin, and stepped forth in his own beautiful proportions.	1320-122617-0012	7.59	Four or five of the latter only lingered about the door of the prison of Uncas, wary but close observers of the manner of their captive.
1320-122617-0022	3.855	The Delawares are children of the tortoise, and they outstrip the deer".	1320-122617-0014	4.9	They drew back a little from the entrance and motioned to the supposed conjurer to enter.
1320-122617-0005	4.4	The bear shook his shaggy sides, and then a well known voice replied:	1320-122617-0015	5.125	But the bear, instead of obeying, maintained the seat it had taken, and growled:
1320-122612-0016	3.49	Run back, Uncas, and bring me the size of the singer's foot.	1320-122617-0017	5.655	Then, as if satisfied of their safety, the scout left his position, and slowly entered the place.
1320-122617-0008	4.185	The young man is in bondage, and much I fear his death is decreed.	1320-122617-0018	9.695	It was silent and gloomy, being tenanted solely by the captive, and lighted by the dying embers of a fire, which had been used for the purposed of cookery.
1320-122617-0005	4.4	The bear shook his shaggy sides, and then a well known voice replied:	1320-122617-0019	8.23	Uncas occupied a distant corner, in a reclining attitude, being rigidly bound, both hands and feet, by strong and painful withes.
1320-122617-0041	4.15	Uncas cast his skin, and stepped forth in his own beautiful proportions.	1320-122617-0020	8.895	The scout, who had left David at the door, to ascertain they were not observed, thought it prudent to preserve his disguise until assured of their privacy.
1320-122617-0022	3.855	The Delawares are children of the tortoise, and they outstrip the deer".	1320-122617-0021	5.335	What shall we do with the Mingoes at the door? They count six, and this singer is as good as nothing".
1320-122617-0022	3.855	The Delawares are children of the tortoise, and they outstrip the deer".	1320-122617-0023	7.815	Uncas, who had already approached the door, in readiness to lead the way, now recoiled, and placed himself, once more, in the bottom of the lodge.
1320-122617-0022	3.855	The Delawares are children of the tortoise, and they outstrip the deer".	1320-122617-0024	7.555	But Hawkeye, who was too much occupied with his own thoughts to note the movement, continued speaking more to himself than to his companion.
1320-122617-0022	3.855	The Delawares are children of the tortoise, and they outstrip the deer".	1320-122617-0025	6.36	So, Uncas, you had better take the lead, while I will put on the skin again, and trust to cunning for want of speed".
1320-122617-0005	4.4	The bear shook his shaggy sides, and then a well known voice replied:	1320-122617-0026	5.225	Well, what can't be done by main courage, in war, must be done by circumvention.
1320-122617-0022	3.855	The Delawares are children of the tortoise, and they outstrip the deer".	1320-122617-0027	5.689938	As soon as these dispositions were made, the scout turned to David, and gave him his parting instructions.
1320-122617-0022	3.855	The Delawares are children of the tortoise, and they outstrip the deer".	1320-122617-0029	7.875	If you are not then knocked on the head, your being a non composser will protect you; and you'll then have a good reason to expect to die in your bed.
1320-122617-0008	4.185	The young man is in bondage, and much I fear his death is decreed.	1320-122617-0031	6.285	Bravely and generously has he battled in my behalf, and this, and more, will I dare in his service".
1320-122617-0022	3.855	The Delawares are children of the tortoise, and they outstrip the deer".	1320-122617-0034	9.485	Hold"! said David, perceiving that with this assurance they were about to leave him; "I am an unworthy and humble follower of one who taught not the damnable principle of revenge.
1320-122617-0022	3.855	The Delawares are children of the tortoise, and they outstrip the deer".	1320-122617-0037	7.18	The Delaware dog"! he said, leaning forward, and peering through the dim light to catch the expression of the other's features; "is he afraid?
1320-122617-0022	3.855	The Delawares are children of the tortoise, and they outstrip the deer".	1320-122617-0039	7.055	The Mohican started on his feet, and shook his shaggy covering, as though the animal he counterfeited was about to make some desperate effort.
1320-122617-0041	4.15	Uncas cast his skin, and stepped forth in his own beautiful proportions.	1320-122617-0040	7.975	He had no occasion to delay, for at the next instant a burst of cries filled the outer air, and ran along the whole extent of the village.
1320-122612-0016	3.49	Run back, Uncas, and bring me the size of the singer's foot.	1320-122617-0041	4.15	Uncas cast his skin, and stepped forth in his own beautiful proportions.
121-127105-0036	4.15	But was that all her reward"? one of the ladies asked.	121-121726-0000	8.46	Also, a popular contrivance whereby love making may be suspended but not stopped during the picnic season.
121-121726-0004	4.02	Heaven, a good place to be raised to.	121-121726-0001	5.925	Harangue The tiresome product of a tireless tongue.
121-121726-0013	2.49	Tied to a woman.	121-121726-0002	4.41	angor, pain. Painful to hear.
121-127105-0008	2.76	He hung fire again. "A woman's.	121-121726-0003	6.755	Hay fever, a heart trouble caused by falling in love with a grass widow.
121-121726-0006	3.895	Heredity, the cause of all our faults.	121-121726-0004	4.02	Heaven, a good place to be raised to.
121-127105-0008	2.76	He hung fire again. "A woman's.	121-121726-0007	6.73	Horse sense, a degree of wisdom that keeps one from betting on the races.
121-121726-0014	3.165	Hypocrite, a horse dealer.	121-121726-0008	4.99	Hose Man's excuse for wetting the walk.
121-121726-0006	3.895	Heredity, the cause of all our faults.	121-121726-0009	7.26	Hotel, a place where a guest often gives up good dollars for poor quarters.
121-127105-0008	2.76	He hung fire again. "A woman's.	121-121726-0010	9.81	Housecleaning, a domestic upheaval that makes it easy for the government to enlist all the soldiers it needs.
121-121726-0014	3.165	Hypocrite, a horse dealer.	121-121726-0011	4.035	Husband, the next thing to a wife.
121-121726-0002	4.41	angor, pain. Painful to hear.	121-121726-0012	4.045	hussy, woman, and bond, tie.
61-70970-0016	4.37	We will go out together to the bower; there is a way down to the court from my window.	61-70970-0000	6.075	Young Fitzooth had been commanded to his mother's chamber so soon as he had come out from his converse with the Squire.
61-70970-0012	3.135	Yet he will teach you a few tricks when morning is come.	61-70970-0001	6.155	There befell an anxious interview, Mistress Fitzooth arguing for and against the Squire's project in a breath.
61-70968-0045	3.475	Pray follow us, with mine and my lord Sheriff's men".	61-70970-0002	4.165	Most of all Robin thought of his father. What would he counsel?
61-70968-0056	3.565	The wine did certainly bring back the color to the Squire's cheeks.	61-70970-0007	4.485	He was in deep converse with the clerk, and entered the hall holding him by the arm.
61-70968-0039	3.805	And mine is Will Stuteley. Shall we be comrades"?	61-70970-0011	6.075	As any in England, I would say," said Gamewell, proudly. "That is, in his day.
61-70968-0016	3.72	And then they became vexed, and would have snatched your purse from us.	61-70970-0013	4.35	There was no chance to alter his sleeping room to one nearer to Gamewell's chamber.
61-70968-0046	3.55	Nottingham Castle was reached, and admittance was demanded.	61-70970-0015	8.415	Will," cried he, softly; and Stuteley, who had chosen his couch across the door of his young master's chamber, sprang up at once in answer.
61-70968-0029	3.495	The Squire helped to thrust them all in and entered swiftly himself.	61-70970-0016	4.37	We will go out together to the bower; there is a way down to the court from my window.
61-70968-0046	3.55	Nottingham Castle was reached, and admittance was demanded.	61-70970-0018	4.6	The hours passed wearily by, and movement could yet be heard about the hall.
61-70970-0009	3.405	Tis late; and I go myself within a short space.	61-70970-0020	5.025	Will," whispered Robin, opening his door as he spoke, "are you ready"?
61-70970-0013	4.35	There was no chance to alter his sleeping room to one nearer to Gamewell's chamber.	61-70970-0021	5.405	They then renewed their journey, and, under the better light, made a safe crossing of the stable roofs.
61-70970-0016	4.37	We will go out together to the bower; there is a way down to the court from my window.	61-70970-0024	7.235	They moved thereafter cautiously about the hut, groping before and about them to find something to show that Warrenton had fulfilled his mission.
61-70970-0016	4.37	We will go out together to the bower; there is a way down to the court from my window.	61-70970-0025	7.435	They were upon the verge of an open trap, in the far corner of the hut; and Stuteley had tripped over the edge of the reversed flap mouth of this pit.
61-70970-0033	3.42	Truly such a horse should be worth much in Nottingham Fair!	61-70970-0026	5.475	Fitzooth's hand rested at last upon the top rung of a ladder, and slowly the truth came to him.
61-70970-0032	3.135	enquired Robin, with his suspicions still upon him.	61-70970-0027	5.08	Robin carefully descended the ladder and found himself soon upon firm rocky ground.
61-70970-0016	4.37	We will go out together to the bower; there is a way down to the court from my window.	61-70970-0028	6.55	Stuteley was by his side in a flash: and then they both began feeling about them to ascertain the shape and character of this vault.
61-70968-0055	3.965	Robin was glad when, at length, they were left to their own devices.	61-70970-0029	4.03	From the blackness behind the light they heard a voice - Warrenton's!
61-70970-0007	4.485	He was in deep converse with the clerk, and entered the hall holding him by the arm.	61-70970-0031	5.135	cried he, waving the lanthorn before him to make sure that these were no ghosts in front of him.
61-70968-0039	3.805	And mine is Will Stuteley. Shall we be comrades"?	61-70970-0034	4.485	Nay, nay, lording," answered Warrenton, with a half laugh.
61-70968-0006	2.935	But then the picture was gone as quickly as it came".	61-70970-0035	7.405	Warrenton spoke thus with significance, to show Robin that he was not to think Geoffrey's claims to the estate would be passed by.
61-70970-0033	3.42	Truly such a horse should be worth much in Nottingham Fair!	61-70970-0036	6.785	Robin Fitzooth saw that his doubts of Warrenton had been unfair: and he became ashamed of himself for harboring them.
61-70968-0052	2.65	But who is this fellow plucking at your sleeve?	61-70970-0037	5.98	His tones rang pleasantly on Warrenton's ears, and forthwith a good fellowship was heralded between them.
61-70968-0046	3.55	Nottingham Castle was reached, and admittance was demanded.	61-70970-0039	6.665	He implores us to be discreet as the grave in this matter, for in sooth his life is in the hollow of our hands".
61-70970-0016	4.37	We will go out together to the bower; there is a way down to the court from my window.	61-70970-0040	4.165	They regained their apartment, apparently without disturbing the household of Gamewell.
5105-28240-0002	4.01	exclaimed Servadac, keeping his eye unmoved at his telescope.	5105-28240-0000	5.455	Fast as his legs could carry him, Servadac had made his way to the top of the cliff.
5105-28240-0016	4.17	To all these inquiries, the count responded in the affirmative.	5105-28240-0002	4.01	exclaimed Servadac, keeping his eye unmoved at his telescope.
5105-28240-0013	2.96	Nothing more than you know yourself".	5105-28240-0003	5.515	She is under sail; but she is Count Timascheff's yacht". He was right.
5105-28240-0014	3.07	Are you certain that this is the Mediterranean"?	5105-28240-0004	6.015	If the count were on board, a strange fatality was bringing him to the presence of his rival.
5105-28240-0014	3.07	Are you certain that this is the Mediterranean"?	5105-28240-0005	7.4	He reckoned, therefore, not only upon ascertaining the extent of the late catastrophe, but upon learning its cause.
5105-28240-0014	3.07	Are you certain that this is the Mediterranean"?	5105-28240-0007	4.625	Servadac took it for granted that the Dobryna was endeavoring to put in.
5105-28241-0014	2.995	Another circumstance was most remarkable.	5105-28240-0011	6.02	I left you on a continent, and here I have the honor of finding you on an island".
5105-28240-0014	3.07	Are you certain that this is the Mediterranean"?	5105-28240-0015	8.525	For some moments he seemed perfectly stupefied; then, recovering himself, he began to overwhelm the count with a torrent of questions.
5105-28240-0002	4.01	exclaimed Servadac, keeping his eye unmoved at his telescope.	5105-28240-0016	4.17	To all these inquiries, the count responded in the affirmative.
5105-28241-0014	2.995	Another circumstance was most remarkable.	5105-28240-0017	5.665	Some mysterious force seemed to have brought about a convulsion of the elements.
5105-28241-0003	3.98	Steam up and canvas spread, the schooner started eastwards.	5105-28240-0019	6.240062	My yacht is at your service, sir, even should you require to make a tour round the world".
5105-28233-0001	4.49	He seemed born to please without being conscious of the power he possessed.	5105-28240-0022	4.725	It was on the last day of January that the repairs of the schooner were completed.
5105-28241-0003	3.98	Steam up and canvas spread, the schooner started eastwards.	5105-28240-0024	8.2	Doubts now arose, and some discussion followed, whether or not it was desirable for Ben Zoof to accompany his master.
1284-1181-0002	3.835	The head of the Patchwork Girl was the most curious part of her.	1284-1181-0003	4.505	The hair was of brown yarn and hung down on her neck in several neat braids.
1284-1180-0027	3.27	Yet that task was not so easy as you may suppose.	1284-1181-0004	7.15	Gold is the most common metal in the Land of Oz and is used for many purposes because it is soft and pliable.
1284-1180-0027	3.27	Yet that task was not so easy as you may suppose.	1284-1181-0007	4.04	She poured into the dish a quantity from each of these bottles.
1284-1180-0027	3.27	Yet that task was not so easy as you may suppose.	1284-1181-0008	6.08	I think that will do," she continued, "for the other qualities are not needed in a servant".
1284-1181-0002	3.835	The head of the Patchwork Girl was the most curious part of her.	1284-1181-0009	5.245	She ran to her husband's side at once and helped him lift the four kettles from the fire.
1284-1181-0002	3.835	The head of the Patchwork Girl was the most curious part of her.	1284-1181-0010	6.435	Their contents had all boiled away, leaving in the bottom of each kettle a few grains of fine white powder.
1284-1181-0002	3.835	The head of the Patchwork Girl was the most curious part of her.	1284-1181-0011	7.75	Very carefully the Magician removed this powder, placing it all together in a golden dish, where he mixed it with a golden spoon.
1284-1180-0004	4.285	When they were outside, Unc simply latched the door and started up the path.	1284-1181-0012	8.51	No one saw him do this, for all were looking at the Powder of Life; but soon the woman remembered what she had been doing, and came back to the cupboard.
1284-1181-0002	3.835	The head of the Patchwork Girl was the most curious part of her.	1284-1181-0014	7.92	He selected a small gold bottle with a pepper box top, so that the powder might be sprinkled on any object through the small holes.
1284-1181-0007	4.04	She poured into the dish a quantity from each of these bottles.	1284-1181-0015	5.115	Most people talk too much, so it is a relief to find one who talks too little".
1284-1181-0007	4.04	She poured into the dish a quantity from each of these bottles.	1284-1181-0016	9.515	I am not allowed to perform magic, except for my own amusement," he told his visitors, as he lighted a pipe with a crooked stem and began to smoke.
1284-1181-0002	3.835	The head of the Patchwork Girl was the most curious part of her.	1284-1181-0020	6.73	Dear me; what a chatterbox you're getting to be, Unc," remarked the Magician, who was pleased with the compliment.
4446-2271-0012	3.78	I say, Sir Harry, the little girl's going famously to night, isn't she"?	4446-2275-0000	6.34	The stop at Queenstown, the tedious passage up the Mersey, were things that he noted dimly through his growing impatience.
4446-2273-0002	3.295	Lamb wouldn't care a great deal about many of them, I fancy".	4446-2275-0001	4.66	She blushed and smiled and fumbled his card in her confusion before she ran upstairs.
4446-2271-0005	3.395	She saves her hand, too. She's at her best in the second act.	4446-2275-0002	7.675	Alexander paced up and down the hallway, buttoning and unbuttoning his overcoat, until she returned and took him up to Hilda's living room.
4446-2271-0006	2.905	He's been wanting to marry Hilda these three years and more.	4446-2275-0005	4.445	I felt it in my bones when I woke this morning that something splendid was going to turn up.
4446-2273-0005	4.125	I haven't had a chance yet to tell you what a jolly little place I think this is.	4446-2275-0007	8.975	She pushed him toward the big chair by the fire, and sat down on a stool at the opposite side of the hearth, her knees drawn up to her chin, laughing like a happy little girl.
4446-2271-0003	3.7	It's been on only two weeks, and I've been half a dozen times already.	4446-2275-0008	4.13	When did you come, Bartley, and how did it happen? You haven't spoken a word".
4446-2275-0035	4.075	Alexander rose and shook himself angrily. "Yes, I know I'm cowardly.	4446-2275-0012	6.025	She looked at his heavy shoulders and big, determined head, thrust forward like a catapult in leash.
4446-2273-0036	3.12	Alexander unclenched the two hands at his sides.	4446-2275-0016	7.3	Hilda watched him from her corner, trembling and scarcely breathing, dark shadows growing about her eyes. "It...
4446-2275-0015	2.98	He pulled up a window as if the air were heavy.	4446-2275-0019	4.93	The world is all there, just as it used to be, but I can't get at it any more.
4446-2273-0033	3.3	For a long time neither Hilda nor Bartley spoke.	4446-2275-0021	5.05	Hilda's face quivered, but she whispered: "Yes, I think it must have been.
4446-2273-0030	2.885	Alexander went over and opened the window for her.	4446-2275-0026	5.495	She closed her eyes and took a deep breath, as if to draw in again the fragrance of those days.
4446-2275-0035	4.075	Alexander rose and shook himself angrily. "Yes, I know I'm cowardly.	4446-2275-0029	6.28	Please tell me one thing, Bartley. At least, tell me that you believe I thought I was making you happy".
4446-2275-0010	3.735	Alexander leaned forward and warmed his hands before the blaze.	4446-2275-0033	7.06	What I mean is that I want you to promise never to see me again, no matter how often I come, no matter how hard I beg".
4446-2271-0011	3.945	Sir Harry Towne, mister Bartley Alexander, the American engineer".	4446-2275-0035	4.075	Alexander rose and shook himself angrily. "Yes, I know I'm cowardly.
4446-2273-0017	2.74	How jolly it was being young, Hilda!	4446-2275-0038	4.53	I will ask the least imaginable, but I must have something!
4446-2271-0005	3.395	She saves her hand, too. She's at her best in the second act.	4446-2275-0040	6.965	The sight of you, Bartley, to see you living and happy and successful can I never make you understand what that means to me"?
4446-2271-0005	3.395	She saves her hand, too. She's at her best in the second act.	4446-2275-0041	4.755	You see, loving some one as I love you makes the whole world different.
4446-2275-0011	2.435	Bartley bent lower over the fire.	4446-2275-0042	5.4	And then you came back, not caring very much, but it made no difference".
4446-2273-0033	3.3	For a long time neither Hilda nor Bartley spoke.	4446-2275-0043	5.88	Bartley bent over and took her in his arms, kissing her mouth and her wet, tired eyes.
5142-33396-0015	4.31	As our boat flashed down the rollers into the water I made this song and sang it:	5142-36377-0001	5.39	In five minutes I was in a new world, and my melancholy room was full of the liveliest French company.
5142-33396-0062	2.9	Now she put her hand on his arm and smiled and said:	5142-36377-0002	5.62	The sound of an imperative and uncompromising bell recalled me in due time to the regions of reality.
5142-33396-0050	2.885	May you drink heart's ease from it for many years.	5142-36377-0004	5.485	She signed to me, with a ghostly solemnity, to take the vacant place on the left of her father.
5142-33396-0023	3.48	It was so dark that I could see nothing but a few sparks on the hearth.	5142-36377-0005	7.085	The door opened again while I was still studying the two brothers, without, I honestly confess, being very favorably impressed by either of them.
5142-33396-0049	3.305	Here, friend, take it,' and he thrust it into the farmer's hand.	5142-36377-0006	4.635	A new member of the family circle, who instantly attracted my attention, entered the room.
5142-33396-0053	3.93	I took five great bracelets of gold from our treasure chest and gave them to him.	5142-36377-0007	6.18	A little cracked" - that in the popular phrase was my impression of the stranger who now made his appearance in the supper room.
5142-36586-0000	3.65	It is manifest that man is now subject to much variability.	5142-36377-0010	4.294937	He is not well; he has come over the ocean for rest, and change of scene.
5142-33396-0023	3.48	It was so dark that I could see nothing but a few sparks on the hearth.	5142-36377-0013	6.585	They pointedly drew back from John Jago as he approached the empty chair next to me and moved round to the opposite side of the table.
5142-33396-0049	3.305	Here, friend, take it,' and he thrust it into the farmer's hand.	5142-36377-0015	4.34	Our first impressions of people are, in nine cases out of ten, the right impressions.
5142-33396-0049	3.305	Here, friend, take it,' and he thrust it into the farmer's hand.	5142-36377-0017	4.685	The only cheerful conversation was the conversation across the table between Naomi and me.
5142-33396-0002	3.67	Two hundred warriors feasted in his hall and followed him to battle.	5142-36377-0018	4.97	He looked up at Naomi doubtingly from his plate, and looked down again slowly with a frown.
5142-33396-0011	3.52	There she sat on the rollers, as fair a ship as I ever saw.	5142-36377-0020	4.53	A more dreary and more disunited family party I never sat at the table with.
5142-36586-0000	3.65	It is manifest that man is now subject to much variability.	5142-36377-0023	5.79	You were quite right to say 'No,'" Ambrose began. "Never smoke with John Jago. His cigars will poison you".
5142-33396-0040	2.81	And these shall follow your thralls in the same way.	5142-36377-0024	5.78	Naomi shook her forefinger reproachfully at them, as if the two sturdy young farmers had been two children.
8555-292519-0015	2.85	He had broken into her courtyard.	8555-292519-0005	9.575	While the old gold and the marble stays, Forever gleaming its soft strong blaze, Calm in the early evening glow.
8555-292519-0013	4.185	That was but rustling of dripping plants in the dark.	8555-292519-0007	8.405	It is my heart hung in the sky; And no clouds ever float between The grave flowers and my heart on high.
8555-292519-0015	2.85	He had broken into her courtyard.	8555-292519-0008	6.025	Over the track lined city street The young men, the grinning men, pass.
8555-284449-0009	3.27	You are, mate," replied the sailor.	8555-292519-0010	5.77	Old dances are simplified of their yearning, bleached by Time.
8555-292519-0015	2.85	He had broken into her courtyard.	8555-292519-0012	5.17	Through the black night rain, he sang to her window bars:
8555-292519-0015	2.85	He had broken into her courtyard.	8555-292519-0013	4.185	That was but rustling of dripping plants in the dark.
5683-32865-0001	2.58	said Lord Chelford, addressing me.	5683-32866-0002	5.125	But don't these very wise things sometimes turn out very foolishly?
5683-32865-0001	2.58	said Lord Chelford, addressing me.	5683-32866-0004	9.225	By this time Lord Chelford and Wylder returned; and, disgusted rather with myself, I ruminated on my want of general ship.
5683-32866-0014	3.97	Don't insult me, Stanley, by talking again as you did this morning.	5683-32866-0005	4.59	and he made a little dip of his cane towards Brandon Hall, over his shoulder.
5683-32866-0008	3.3	Bracton's a very good fellow, I can assure you.	5683-32866-0006	4.215	Yes, so they said; but that would, I think, have been worse.
5683-32879-0001	3.66	Well, she was better, though she had had a bad night.	5683-32866-0007	4.12	If a fellow's been a little bit wild, he's Beelzebub at once.
5683-32866-0015	2.83	What I say is altogether on your own account.	5683-32866-0011	7.37	Their walk continued silent for the greater part, neither was quite satisfied with the other. But Rachel at last said
5683-32866-0015	2.83	What I say is altogether on your own account.	5683-32866-0012	8.26	Now that's impossible, Radie; for I really don't think I once thought of him all this evening - except just while we were talking.
5683-32866-0014	3.97	Don't insult me, Stanley, by talking again as you did this morning.	5683-32866-0013	9.93	There was a bright moonlight, broken by the shadows of overhanging boughs and withered leaves; and the mottled lights and shadows glided oddly across his pale features.
5683-32866-0006	4.215	Yes, so they said; but that would, I think, have been worse.	5683-32866-0016	4.88	Mark my words, you'll find him too strong for you; aye, and too deep.
5683-32865-0001	2.58	said Lord Chelford, addressing me.	5683-32866-0017	4.585	I am very uneasy about it, whatever it is. I can't help it.
5683-32879-0001	3.66	Well, she was better, though she had had a bad night.	5683-32866-0018	5.455	To my mind there has always been something inexpressibly awful in family feuds.
5683-32866-0001	3.47	And he added something still less complimentary.	5683-32866-0021	7.9	My bed was unexceptionably comfortable, but, in my then mood, I could have wished it a great deal more modern.
5683-32866-0014	3.97	Don't insult me, Stanley, by talking again as you did this morning.	5683-32866-0024	9.855	I shan't trouble you about my train of thoughts or fancies; but I began to feel very like a gentleman in a ghost story, watching experimentally in a haunted chamber.
5683-32866-0008	3.3	Bracton's a very good fellow, I can assure you.	5683-32866-0027	4.755	A cold, bright moon was shining with clear sharp lights and shadows.
5683-32879-0012	4.38	Thank you, Rachel, my Cousin Rachel, my only friend.	5683-32866-0028	5.62	The sombre old trees, like gigantic hearse plumes, black and awful.
5683-32866-0003	2.865	In the meantime I had formed a new idea of her.	5683-32866-0030	4.845	A little bit of plaster tumbled down the chimney, and startled me confoundedly.
8555-284447-0020	4.09	The goat's warlike spirit was roused by this successful attack.	8555-284449-0001	8.63	Then they all marched out a little way into the fields and found that the Army of Pinkies had already formed and was advancing steadily toward them.
8555-284447-0020	4.09	The goat's warlike spirit was roused by this successful attack.	8555-284449-0003	8.875	When the Blueskins saw Ghip Ghisizzle they raised another great shout, for he was the favorite of the soldiers and very popular with all the people.
8555-284447-0003	4.415	But Captain Bill made no such attempt, knowing it would be useless.	8555-284449-0007	9.31	Now, then, let's enter the City and enjoy the grand feast that's being cooked. I'm nearly starved, myself, for this conquering kingdoms is hard work".
8555-284447-0020	4.09	The goat's warlike spirit was roused by this successful attack.	8555-284449-0008	6.135	Then she gave Rosalie back her magic ring, thanking the kind Witch for all she had done for them.
8555-284447-0020	4.09	The goat's warlike spirit was roused by this successful attack.	8555-284449-0012	9.87	I'll gladly do that," promised the new Boolooroo; "and I'll feed the honorable goat all the shavings and leather and tin cans he can eat, besides the grass.
8555-284447-0003	4.415	But Captain Bill made no such attempt, knowing it would be useless.	8555-284449-0013	5.775	Scuse me," said Trot; "I neglected to tell you that you're not the Boolooroo any more.
8555-292519-0013	4.185	That was but rustling of dripping plants in the dark.	8555-284449-0015	5.12	I'll not be wicked any more," sighed the old Boolooroo; "I'll reform.
8555-284447-0022	3.56	I had a notion it was you, mate, as saved me from the knife.	8555-284449-0016	5.895	As a private citizen I shall be a model of deportment, because it would be dangerous to be otherwise".
8555-284447-0020	4.09	The goat's warlike spirit was roused by this successful attack.	8555-284449-0018	7.03	So Ghip Ghisizzle ordered the Captain to take a file of soldiers and escort the raving beauties to their new home.
8555-284447-0020	4.09	The goat's warlike spirit was roused by this successful attack.	8555-284449-0019	7.61	That evening Trot gave a grand ball in the palace, to which the most important of the Pinkies and the Blueskins were invited.
8555-284447-0020	4.09	The goat's warlike spirit was roused by this successful attack.	8555-284449-0020	5.095	The combined bands of both the countries played the music and a fine supper was served.
