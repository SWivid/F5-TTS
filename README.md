# F5-TTS: A Fairytaler that Fakes Fluent and Faithful Speech with Flow Matching

**F5-TTS**: Diffusion Transformer with ConvNeXt V2, faster trained and inference.

**E2 TTS**: Flat-UNet Transformer, closest reproduction from [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18009).

**Sway Sampling**: Inference-time flow step sampling strategy, greatly improves performance

### Thanks to all the contributors !

## News
Spanish model: https://huggingface.co/jpgallegoar/F5-Spanish/

## Installation

```bash
# Create a python 3.10 conda env (you could also use virtualenv)
conda create -n f5-tts python=3.10
conda activate f5-tts

# Install pytorch with your CUDA version, e.g.
pip install torch==2.3.0+cu118 torchaudio==2.3.0+cu118 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

Then you can choose from a few options below:

### 1. As a pip package (if just for inference)

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/jpgallegoar/Spanish-F5.git
```

### 2. Local editable (if also do training, finetuning)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jpgallegoar/Spanish-F5.git
cd F5-TTS
# git submodule update --init --recursive  # (optional, if need bigvgan)
pip install -e .
```
If initialize submodule, you should add the following code at the beginning of `src/third_party/BigVGAN/bigvgan.py`.
```python
import os
import sys
sys.path.append(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))
```

## Inference

### 1. Gradio App

Currently supported features:

- Basic TTS with Chunk Inference
- Multi-Style / Multi-Speaker Generation
- Voice Chat powered by Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct

```bash
# Launch a Gradio app (web interface)
f5-tts_infer-gradio

# Specify the port/host
f5-tts_infer-gradio --port 7860 --host 0.0.0.0

# Launch a share link
f5-tts_infer-gradio --share
```

### 2. CLI Inference

```bash
# Run with flags
# Leave --ref_text "" will have ASR model transcribe (extra GPU memory usage)
f5-tts_infer-cli \
--model "F5-TTS" \
--ref_audio "ref_audio.wav" \
--ref_text "The content, subtitle or transcription of reference audio." \
--gen_text "Some text you want TTS model generate for you."

# Run with default setting. src/f5_tts/infer/examples/basic/basic.toml
f5-tts_infer-cli
# Or with your own .toml file
f5-tts_infer-cli -c custom.toml

# Multi voice. See src/f5_tts/infer/README.md
f5-tts_infer-cli -c src/f5_tts/infer/examples/multi/story.toml
```

### 3. More instructions

- In order to have better generation results, take a moment to read [detailed guidance](src/f5_tts/infer).
- The [Issues](https://github.com/SWivid/F5-TTS/issues?q=is%3Aissue) are very useful, please try to find the solution by properly searching the keywords of problem encountered. If no answer found, then feel free to open an issue.


## Training

### 1. Gradio App

Read [training & finetuning guidance](src/f5_tts/train) for more instructions.

```bash
# Quick start with Gradio web interface
f5-tts_finetune-gradio
```


## [Evaluation](src/f5_tts/eval)


## Development

Use pre-commit to ensure code quality (will run linters and formatters automatically)

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

When making a pull request, before each commit, run: 

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Note: Some model components have linting exceptions for E722 to accommodate tensor notation
